(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:09 PM
 Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:09 PM
 but this will help us uh stay on track with whatever our action items are that we walked away with

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:10 PM
 Um, okay. I'll help save me his account. I think I'm just gonna, uh, I'm just gonna do that. Um, so regular insurance.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:10 PM
 Wait, hold on. What?

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:10 PM
 Okay, go ahead.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:10 PM
 Hold on. Start over again because I didn't hear, I didn't hear exactly what you said.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:10 PM
 Okay. So first item of Business, Health Savings Account.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:10 PM
 Yeah.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:10 PM
 Um, I sent you the information in the screenshot of information. Um,  So I think at this point, it's good for me to do this, so regular insurance.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:10 PM
 Yes.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:10 PM
 A month. If I or a paycheck, if I did 250 per paycheck, I could just start building my account. Um, mammograms are covered 100%, And that's all I really need. I mean knock on wood. I mean, we're all pretty healthy. Um,

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:10 PM
 Uhuh.  Exactly.  Uh,

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:10 PM
 but the thing is, they both have the same deductible. It's a $0 deductible whether it's traditional or health savings, so, whatever, I'm still going to have to pay out upon, okay. So I might as well just, you know, start building a little savings account instead of it going into the black hole and then restarting next year again.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:11 PM
 right.  Right. Yeah, 100%.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:11 PM
 You know, like like fight Insurance. Okay, so that's a no. But okay, so then on this letter I should have sent you. Let me just take a picture. I'll send it to you. Hold on.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:11 PM
 Yeah. Yeah.

 Um, so  uh, I think so. Hold on.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:12 PM
 Okay.  so,  Let's do this. We can just take care of this real quick.  if you would,

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:12 PM

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:13 PM
 Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:13 PM

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:15 PM
 Yeah.  What's the title of that? Yeah. What's the title of that account? Does it say like Peggy Phillips IRA?

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:15 PM
 Right.  Yes.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:15 PM
 Perfect. Let me call them tomorrow and see.  If that account is still active so that you can just transfer the money from the IRA from the 401K straight into that.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:15 PM
 Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:15 PM
 We'll go ahead and open a new account.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:15 PM
 Okay, so  What, what did you say?

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:15 PM
 Go ahead and click open new account.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:15 PM
 Okay, okay. so then we have a a bunch of uh, so then we have health savings account, learn more

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:15 PM
 Go ahead and click the. And you want a self-directed, self-directed not crypto.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:16 PM
 Okay, so  Okay, so my option is to open an HSA.  So then I talk to you. Late the information, my first name?  My last name.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:16 PM
 and when you get to the referral,

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:16 PM
 Um,

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:16 PM
 When you get to the referring.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:16 PM
 hold on.  Yeah, I have a question.  so,  What little information was included in the uh, benefits handbook, was that you set up your own account for the HSA funds to direct into from the paycheck?

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:16 PM
 Correct.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:17 PM
 now, my question is,  if I, if I have a health expense, that's say, I've hit my thousand dollar deductible and, you know, I need to  Go to the doctor for a follow-up or something. How do I is is this fun going to let me pull from it because the way  the way it described in the benefits book is they sent you a little HSA debit card that you can only use for qualified Health purchase. So I I assume that they would send me 1

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:17 PM
 Yes.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:17 PM
 I don't. Okay, they probably will. I mean if it said if it's directed to HSA as part of their process they're probably going to send me an HSA card. It's going to be only used for

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:17 PM
 I mean this is how this is how month, this is, how hsas work. So if they're offering a health savings account, it's with the assumption that they're going to be a need to pull money to pay for health expenses.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:17 PM
 Okay, okay.  They obviously.  Right. Right, I've never done this before. I'm just thinking through it. Okay?

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:17 PM
 If?

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:17 PM
 All right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:17 PM
 Yes, now remember your deductible is all the money that you're on the hook for upfront before the health insurance kicks in.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:17 PM
 So you, you will.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:17 PM
 I know. But

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:18 PM
 You will have to pay $3,000 in a given policy year.  Before out of your HSA or out of your own pocket, before the insurance kicks in. I just want to make sure that you recall that that's how it works.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:18 PM
 oh, I know, but I have to do that with traditional Insurance. Anyway,

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:18 PM
 Okay.  Alright. Alright.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:18 PM
 Okay.  Um, hold just give me a second here. I'm setting this up. Hold on.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:18 PM
 Are you doing family coverage or or sell only?

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:18 PM
I mean, I have to cover the kids. They can't be without health insurance.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:19 PM
 Oh, okay. Yeah.  You. Yeah, so that means you can put up to 375 dollars a week in or per paycheck. Every 20. If you get paid by weekly, you can put up to 375 for the contribution limit.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:19 PM
 I know, but I'm not going to be able to afford that I have other commitments.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:19 PM
 That's okay, I'm just letting you know, this does come with contribution limits. Your limit is 375 on a 26 pay.  If you if you have get paid 26 times a year. So this is just informational only

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:19 PM
 Okay.  I know, but I think the minimum  I mean, I think the minimum would at least be what you would pay with a traditional, which would be 240.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:19 PM
 That is the opportunity cost. If you're already planning on paying the 240, you might as well put it back into your own pocket.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:19 PM
 Exactly, so if I just paid 250, I mean.  What's ten dollars, right?

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:19 PM
 Right.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:20 PM
 Okay.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:20 PM
Oh, I can't set up a new account because it doesn't like my email.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:20 PM
 What do you mean it?

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:20 PM
 It says this account.  so,  I have Peggy M Daniels at gmail.com for my director of the IRA.  But when I'm setting up this HSA, it doesn't like that email address.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:20 PM
 What hold on?  You can't say it doesn't like that, that doesn't make sense. What is the

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:20 PM
 it says a certain, it says,  It said it's already in use.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:20 PM

 No, I don't know why you're getting upset. Like if we just if you just walk through it and you verbalize what you're seeing, we could go through it. A lot faster and neither 1 of us would get frustrated, like there's no.

 Okay, great. Do you want some good news?

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:42 PM
 What's the good news?

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:42 PM
 You are allowed to roll over from an IRA to an HSA.  and,

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:42 PM
 Oh, oh.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:42 PM
 your, your 401k if you were to take a distribution, they would withhold taxes, but if you roll it over to the IRA at,

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:42 PM
 Directed IRA.  Then you can transfer it internally, once it arrives at directed Ira, we can do a 1-time. You get once in your lifetime, the rollover funds from an IRA to an HSA and this is the perfect scenario for how you should do this, because it will fund 3,000 dollars of that. HSA right up front, which means no out-of-pocket contribution for the cash, minimum plus you get to start

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:43 PM
You're doing $50 every 2 weeks, right? Uh, 48 120 at a contribution as if you'd been contributing for the last 13 or 14 weeks.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:43 PM
 Yeah, that's awesome.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:43 PM
 Plus.  Plus, what did you say? The deductible was on your health insurance?

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:43 PM
 Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:43 PM
 So we're going to take the IRA from cath, the 401K from Catholic Care. We're going to send it to directed Ira so that they do not withhold any taxes and it does not create a taxable event a direct transfer.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:43 PM
 I'm sorry a direct rollover. And then once the funds uh reach directed Ira, we are going to instruct directed Ira to roll those funds over from the IRA to the HSA. Thereby giving you access to the deductible in full cash out of the HSA. Giving you a 14 week, jump on your HSA and preventing you from having to pay any fees or make any mandatory minimum contributions up front.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:44 PM
Oh man, that's awesome. Talk about perfect timing.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:44 PM
 I mean, I don't know why more people don't want to work with me.  Like literally other people that would have done, this would have lost 20% to the IRS right away because they would have withdrawn from the 401K they would have hit the contribution limits on the HSA and they probably would not have had such a they it wouldn't it would have impacted their cash flow.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:44 PM
 Right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:44 PM
 so,  Anyways. Okay, well, there you go. So you've got that going, I'm gonna call. I'm gonna call Direct and I already tomorrow and make sure all this stuff got set up correctly. Make sure that IRA account is still active because we need to use it and then we'll go from there.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:44 PM
 Okay.  so, okay, so now

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:44 PM
 Okay, so my next question, on to the next item of business.  Is I got so Good Samaritan. Uh it hasn't gone away. I got a letter. Um I now owe like a dollar because of that bonus I took and haven't paid back because I didn't stay for 2 years.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:45 PM
 Okay.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:45 PM
 um,  so,

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:45 PM
 What is the? Hold on. A, you have not responded to them, have you?

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:45 PM
No.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:45 PM
 Okay good.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:45 PM
 Um, no, I haven't. Hold on, I owe uh, 8,150. I did respond. I think it was 2 years ago. They tried to say that. It was student debt and I said, this is not student debt.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:45 PM
 I tried to put it in the student debt, uh, bucket and I said I was never a student. This is not a student debt.  So then I didn't hear from him. I heard from him again last year.  Um, and I didn't respond.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:45 PM
 What can you send me? Can you send me the letter?

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:45 PM
 Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:45 PM
 Send me the letter, let me digest that so that I can determine when appropriate course of action for that.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:45 PM
 Okay. Um yeah. That's that's hanging out out there.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:46 PM
 We may, we may there's a company there's a company that I have access to called, AC Credit Services, they are really good, we might engage them to just go have this out for us, right?

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:46 PM
 Uh, okay. Um  I don't know about that. I worked with him back in uh spring of 2024 and the lady they put me with. She was clueless.  She she tried to tell me, I had she tried to tell me. I had 60,000 dollars of student loan debt. I said, I do not have 60,000 dollars of student loan debt. I said that it's pay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:46 PM
What casts?  Wait.  Hold on.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:46 PM
 She didn't know what she was doing.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:46 PM
 Okay, but you are not even sure that we are talking about the same company.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:46 PM
 Yeah, it's Casey credit. Yes. Yes, I it. Well, go ahead. You to you can hook me up with whoever it is, but you did hook me up with Casey credit. I called, they put me with an agent. She was clueless. I said, I do not owe 60 thousand dollars of student loan debt. I said, look at that. Credit report carefully that is all paid off.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:47 PM
 Okay, was this?

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:47 PM
and she said,

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:47 PM
 Was this a lady named Sherry uselman?

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:47 PM
 Oh, I don't know who. Well she didn't know what she was doing, anyway.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:47 PM
 Okay. Hold on. Hold the phone.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:47 PM
 Um, but let me think about the letter.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:47 PM
 Just send me the letter but was this the credit was this? The credit consult uh the credit debt, resolution that I suggested?

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:47 PM
 I think so.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:47 PM
 okay, again, there's no way that that could have been Casey Credit Services,

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:47 PM
 Okay, well I don't know. I I was on the phone with her twice. I said I'm not I'm not going to pursue this anyway here.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:47 PM
 so,

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:47 PM
 um,  And I think I think it was about. I think it was about um the the 6000 tuition for pharmacy school. I was trying to kind of work something out with that.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:47 PM
 oh my God.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:47 PM
 I think that's why you put me in contact with I think. And I just said screw it. I just I just knocked out, epcos assignments and paid it off. I should, you know, it's good anyway. What I don't remember. Remember what it was about there was a lot going on my and, and 2024,

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:48 PM
 Yeah. Well  I understand, I understand. But if you can just pause for a second, I I don't know. Like  What is this? Why are you talking so fast? That? That's a lot of information. And I'm only going to tell you this. I have never recommended Casey Credit Services to anyone. This is a relationship that I found independently and I haven't recommended it to anyone at all yet.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:48 PM
 And so, when you tell me that you already work with them,

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:48 PM
Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:48 PM
 I'm thinking, oh, like 10 years ago but then you said you recommended them to me. And I know for a fact, we're not talking about same company because I have not recommended them yet.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:48 PM
 Okay, so it's back up so maybe it wasn't in case you credit but

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:49 PM
 Weightless.  Weightless Financial weightless, Financial had an intake person, whose whole job was just to take your details and explain to you the program that person does not work on the debt though. So, whatever I say.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:49 PM
 It was.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:49 PM
Their program is actually good. I didn't know that was your experience. Otherwise, I would have jumped in and said, hey, here's the real deal. This is what we need just do. What I tell you to do, if you had, let me know that that's what you were struggling with, they would have gone with what I said. But regardless, whoever that intake person was their job was just to take your numbers, explained the program and sign you up. The people who work on the debt behind, the scenes is an actual Consumer Credit Law Firm,

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:49 PM
 Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:49 PM
 So you never bought to the point where you experienced, the debt resolution. You just had somebody who couldn't read a spreadsheet that day.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:50 PM
 Okay, so let me send you. Okay, and that makes more sense. But anyway,

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:50 PM
 The reason I want to suggest that is because for $8,000, if you let's say, you have to spend 8,000 to pay it off, okay?

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:50 PM
I got my.  Uhuh.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:50 PM
 You can spend a thousand dollars and get a negotiated settlement at 4,000 and then you're only out 5 instead of 8.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:50 PM
 To do that work. Either you or I to do it ourselves, save the thousand dollars, but it would be a lot of administrative work. We would have to track every letter. We would have to track dates. We would have to go

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:50 PM
 Right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:50 PM
 To bat, right?  I think it would be better for you to go focus on Esco and push this off. Knowing someone else whoever we might find is going to take care of it and get you a settlement if you can settle for even 60%, but you were gonna have to pay a, that's better than nothing.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:51 PM
 Right. Okay. So let me

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:51 PM
 And you won't have to, you won't have to think about it. So all the time that we're going to spend mailing out priorities and keeping track of mailing, dates and mailing them to the wall on what they did. Or didn't say

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:51 PM
 Somebody else can take care of that, you'll have the whole 8,000 dollars earned from epsco by the time, and all metrics a year or 2 from now anyways.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:51 PM
 okay. Okay, that sounds like a plan. All right, so here's the reason. You copy the letter.  And you take a look at it and I'll just do whatever you tell me to do here. Let me get a copy. Let me send you a picture of the letter.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:51 PM
 Yeah. Okay.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:52 PM
All righty.  Okay.  Okay, so you should have the letter.  And okay, so I'll just wait to hear back from you on that.  Now.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:52 PM
 I'll take a look at it this week.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:52 PM
 The Next Step.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:52 PM
 So that we can figure out what to do.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:52 PM
 Okay. And the final the final thing is on the fence. The guy that was going to come out I don't think he ever came out look at it. I think he's kind of irresponsible and just I think he's just organized. Um so I just

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:52 PM
 Oh, geez. Seriously. Okay, you want me to just do it?

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:52 PM
 Well, hold on. Yes, I do. But I I mean

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:52 PM
 With you because I'm coming down this week. I mean coming down this week,

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:52 PM
 Okay.  Okay, hold on.  you can, um,  uh, let me give you an update on the claim and the settlement.  the um,

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:52 PM
 Okay.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:52 PM
 the first, the I've had 2 people look at it.  1 was Partridge dripping which was uh, Brock's Brock's friend and he came out and gave me an estimate and then he submitted the the estimate to insurance and he said the plywood has to be replaced because it's not within code, which is probably true because the house was built in 1955.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:53 PM
 The plywood, the plywood for the roof, right?

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:53 PM
 so, the Yeah. Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:53 PM
 Okay, got it.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:53 PM
 Yeah, so the claims adjuster call me, she said we're we're increasing the settlement by 000 because the plywood has to be okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:53 PM
 Okay.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:53 PM
 um,  So, I don't know if so that's the roof situation.  So and so it was 14,000 now it's I get this like 3,000 so now it's like 17,000 shut them up for the roof.  I get 3,000 dollars for the north side and the front side of the siding. Now the siding guy was supposed to come out Wednesday or Thursday, I said go on out and look I'm not going to be here. I didn't hear back from him. I don't know. I'm gonna follow up Monday.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:53 PM
 And the fence guy, I said, go on out and look, I'm not going to be home. I didn't hear back from him, but I don't care. I'm not going to go with him anyway.  Um, I need to pull my claim and find out what what has been earmarked for the Post replacement? If you want to do it now? That's fine. I don't know that I have the cash to pay you. Now it's the thing.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:54 PM
 Well you won't you won't have to pay me. Now what we'll do is you'll you'll have to, you'll have to purchase them materials but luckily we have some float right now. Alright, so we'll go get the materials. I will bill it out through cut rates.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:54 PM
 And give you the invoices, the estimates, the, the costs right? I'll do all of that.  you pay for that and then  we'll get a reimbursement on.  We'll get the cut check from insurance once they process everything and that'll just go back into your account. So it's really just a float of, you know, getting it

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:54 PM
 Getting it to the insurance and waiting for them to pay back out. But I'm assuming you're going to need a cool

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:54 PM
Okay, okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:54 PM
 Quote, right? You're going to need to send them an estimate for this.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:55 PM
 For the fence. Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:55 PM
 Right.  But when I come down this week,  I will, I will measure everything out, I will, you know, give the quote, whatever and then we'll figure out what we want to do from there. I'll quote them for the full for like the full replacement.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:55 PM
 Of the of the deal.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:55 PM
 Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:55 PM
 Of the that at least that side of the fence, right?

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:55 PM
 Right. Those sections and posts, right?

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:55 PM
 Yeah. Yeah, so I mean, I'm gonna, I'm gonna say, this is what needs to be done. You can't have a, you can't have a good fence with old tickets, like that's just not, it's not going to be the same and I will just I'll write it up that way.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:55 PM
 Right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:55 PM
 So, um,

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:55 PM
 Okay.  Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:55 PM
 And then yes. So then that way I can do it if I let Gene know about it I'm sure she can help me get those put in and we'll have it done in an afternoon. We'll have that fence fixed before the end of the week.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:55 PM
 Oh, okay. Well, that sounds good. Okay.  Okay, so those are the, those are the main things I want to head on to, uh today. So thank you for walking me through that. Um, HSA thing, I probably, I'm sure I could have figured it out. I I wasn't aware though that with that directed Ira that that was 1 of the features of the directed Ira uh, uh product. So, um, I'm glad that I didn't have to go out there and try to grow, you know, find an HS, you know.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:56 PM
 Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:56 PM
 Yep.  Right. Nope.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:56 PM
They can be all consolidated.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:56 PM
 Yes, and I think there's a benefit there is I already work with them. I know they're a good company. Like we don't have to and I don't get any commission or anything for working with them. I just like them.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:56 PM
 Okay, alright. Alright, so tomorrow, you know, make sure the account's still active verify my social um because it was in there wrong.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:56 PM
 so,  yes, you  Yes, you will receive an email from them with the HSA account number once. It's been once they've gone through their process and set it up,

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:56 PM
 Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:56 PM
 The, they might need to call you because the social security thing, I might have to tell them to reach out to you to verify. Um,  Because I I did try to try to deal with your account earlier and they said, the social was wrong and I didn't I didn't think anything of it because we weren't using that Ira anyways, but now we need to use it. So um I'll call them tomorrow and get it, sorted out.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:56 PM
 Okay.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:57 PM
 Right.  Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:57 PM
 Once you get that HSA account number, you can submit it to your benefits department. So they know where to send the deductions.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:57 PM
 Right. And we have plenty of time on that because um, enrollment is November 1st and new hires are only going to get December for the 2025 plan. But it'll it, I mean, it's fine. I I mean what I have 30 days,

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:57 PM
 I have 30 days to set up my HSA, but I only get it for December. And then in November, I have to set it up for, for January for, but I already have it set up.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:57 PM
 Right.  Right.  Yeah. Yeah. No that'll be fine and let you know. Luckily you're getting that rollover that we're going to put into the HSA. So we're going to we're going to pre-fund it early. So it will have there will be enough cash. If you hit the deductible for some reason, there will be enough cash to cover, that completely outside of everything else. You've got going on.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:58 PM
 And you won't have to feel it come out of your cash flow.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:58 PM
Yeah, that's awesome. And the other thing I mean yeah I'm I'm going to go 2 2 months without health insurance but they won't start pulling it from my paycheck until

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:58 PM
 um,

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:58 PM
 Oh, probably November. Yeah, or December? Yeah.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:58 PM
 December 1st.  Right? So so I get like 5 paychecks uh that I get that dollars. That's $500 a month that I can just ship away to my other stuff with

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:58 PM
 Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah, so keep using your, yep.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:58 PM
 Like the car like the car.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:58 PM
 Keep using your bill pay. I hope that you know, I know we had to buy extra stuff for the car, so it was a thousand dollars instead of 2,000 but hopefully that, you know, that'll make it back up pretty quick.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:58 PM
 Oh yeah. No cars. Working great. I so appreciate your help. Yeah, it's it's it's

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:58 PM
 Good.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:58 PM
 It's good. And I got the title situated and

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:58 PM
 Please don't buy any more cars until you can talk to somebody. My God you should only ever buy your cars through email from now on like in fact you don't need somebody else. Just do your car purchases through email.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:59 PM
 I know.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:59 PM
 That's the only way you operate on car purchases from here on out.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:59 PM
 Email with you.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:59 PM
 No, no no. I mean email with the sales people.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:59 PM
Oh. Oh. Oh, okay. Well I don't

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:59 PM
 Right? Because it Nails them down.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:59 PM
Right, it does okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:59 PM
 And actually I don't I I actually like this car better than the other 1 you had. This 1 actually feels like it's a nicer vehicle.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:59 PM
 You mean versus the Camry?

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:59 PM
 Yeah.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:59 PM
 Or the Hyundai Sonata.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 07:59 PM
 No, this 1 versus the 1. You just got you, you gave to Dominic.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 07:59 PM
 Oh, oh well, no, the Camry is pretty nice. It it actually is I I, I think I paid too much for it.  But it's been really reliable, and it's a good car and it's a good car for Dom. I mean, it'll get him through college. And hopefully the next 2 or 3 years after college. It is it's good car.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:00 PM
 Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, okay, I do, I did want to talk to you about something. So I've been thinking about this struck purchase and I'm still kind of on the fence about it.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:00 PM
 um,

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:00 PM
 I'm trying to identify.  Whether it's something that I just want to do because it sounds like I could do it in which case, I don't think I should do it, if that's the only reason right. Does that make sense?

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:00 PM
 absolutely.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:00 PM
 but, on the other hand,

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:00 PM
 Um,

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:00 PM
 I really need something that I can do that.  Quicker to the money than the, the, the sales cycle of life insurance. It's a, it's a, it's a minimum, 3 months. But when I talk to somebody, even if I was able to get them into underwriting, the first conversation that I talked to them, they're not getting through inside of 3 months.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:00 PM
 It just doesn't happen, right? If we do. I if we do Ira or 401K transfers, all of them you've been through that, it all it takes weeks to get that money moved.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:01 PM
Right. And, and  Oh, it takes weeks. It's they're just so small.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:01 PM
 Yeah.  So my the other side of my thought process is that I really need something that I can go out and do if it's if I don't have any life insurance appointments for the week.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:01 PM
 I could go run a Google ad and go.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:01 PM
 Like, you're not making income.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:01 PM
 Right. Well, I mean, technically I am because the, you know, I have renewals I have things that come in  that aren't based on my appointments, but I just there's a, there's a feast or famine cycle that I'm trying to get rid of, right? Um,

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:01 PM
 I understand.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:01 PM
 This summer, I went and did some stuff with the girls. We did a couple of yard cleanups, I cut some bushes back for people, right? And we probably made we probably made a couple thousand dollars just in a couple of days.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:01 PM
 And I was using my you I was using my Yukon I was using the, the SUV, right? Which is like, weird, is it, you know, I'm gonna go cut a bunch of branches and I show up in an SUV and I start shoving them in the back, right? Like, it's

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:01 PM
 Well, I did it.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:02 PM
 so, I

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:02 PM
and you have a 12 year old and a 12 year old and a 10 year old like

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:02 PM
 Yeah.  Right? So I do think that with a with a more professionalized truck especially 1 that's prepped and ready for operations.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:02 PM
 I think it could be a, it could be a good idea, it could, you know, and I actually already talked to you, you know what? Okay, don't tell anybody this right.  I talked, I talked to the guy who manages all the contracts for the snow and ice that we've been getting, right? So this year we took on the Amazon warehouses.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:02 PM
 yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:02 PM
 In Witchita.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:02 PM
Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:02 PM
 He told me, he said, I have 2 Amazon. That I need covered in Kansas City.  You want to cover them?

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:02 PM
 Oh s***.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:03 PM
 These are these are 6 Figure contracts.  These would bring in.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:03 PM
 Oh, are you?

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:03 PM
 Uh, yes, no, I'm dead serious. These would bring in a couple hundred thousand, maybe a hundred to 110, 150,000 dollars a year.  But not a year between November and April.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:03 PM
 Yeah, but okay.  Well okay my question is and you can't predict whether but we had you know, at least in which we might have 2 or 3 at the moment.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:03 PM
 Uh, spells of snow and ice that requires, snow and ice removal.  so,

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:03 PM
 So the way that Amazon contracts work is they are what's called zero? They're called Zero Tolerance, which means they expect you to go out and start clearing when the event starts, right? But the flip side is they pay November December, January, February, March, and April, whether or not there's snow.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:04 PM
 Yeah.  Okay. Oh, oh, they tell you whether you have to show up or not.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:04 PM
 this is,  Aha, this is the key that makes this all kind of makes sense.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:04 PM
 Oh,  oh, you okay, then it should go. Are you serious?

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:04 PM
Yes.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:04 PM
 Because with 1 season with 1 season, you can pay, you can totally pay the truck and plow off, you can pay the insurance and you can pay the tags.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:04 PM
 Huh.  Yep.  No. I know. It could all be. It could all be done right away.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:04 PM
 Between November and April. So they pay you to retain you so that they don't have people saying well we don't we can't do it anymore, right?

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:04 PM
 Yes. exactly, yes, yes, so that when you do a contract,

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:04 PM
 But they secure, they secure the work.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:04 PM
 When you do a contract this large, that's what it does.  so,

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:04 PM
 Wow.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:04 PM
 Okay, so  that he, I did not tell Chris about that, this is between me and that guy, and I would probably spin up another, I would spin up a separate company to be able to operate this from,

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:05 PM
 Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:05 PM
 But I I gotta have something that's mind that doesn't that can't get rat fuk with stupid decisions.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:05 PM
 Oh s***. Andy Exactly. Now, how many are there you said? There's 2 Amazon facilities.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:05 PM
 Yes.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:05 PM
 How are you going to do both if they both expect uh customer service. Like how are you going to do both?

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:05 PM
 Well, I I had I did not think it was possible, right? I said, well, there's no way I'm equipped to do that.  This guy.  This guy.  That I work with, he said, if you can find contractors, you can bring contractors through the site.  You can bring them to the sites and you can have them do it as long as you can promise me that I won't have to deal with the problems.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:05 PM
 oh, Hello.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:06 PM
And I said, well I'll I'll run it with a tape. I'll run it with a tape first, for sure.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:06 PM
 Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:06 PM
 so,

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:06 PM
 Oh s***, Annie. If they're gonna pay you November through April, you can subcontract out that even if you even if you gave your contractor, you know, for 30,000 or something, you'd still get 60,000, you can put the truck and the tags and the insurance.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:06 PM
 Yeah.  Oh yeah.  Yes. Yeah.  Yes, then for that.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:06 PM
 How much is the truck?

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:06 PM
 It's 40.  So here's what and then. So here's where I thought, how that would work.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:06 PM
 Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:06 PM
 We would not, we would not try to do it all up front, what we would do is probably offer, we'd offer a 10,000 down payment.  and,  We'd offer a ten thousand dollar down payment.  Which is 25% of the loan. If you're offering 25% of a car loan, you're going to get a loan, no matter what, at a pretty good rate.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:06 PM
 Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:06 PM
 And so that would be where we could a not use up all the funds that you have available, but just get the asset so it can start producing money.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:07 PM
Right. Right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:07 PM
but,  I don't know. It feels I just  It feels like everything's lined up and I'm not ready for it to be lined up yet, which is so frustrating.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:07 PM
 Well, do I mean?

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:07 PM
 Does that mean? Like it's not like I'm not ready, mentally. I don't have I don't have everything organized the way I want it. Organized to be ready for this opportunity.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:07 PM
 What do you need organized?

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:07 PM
 Um,

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:07 PM
 You have a place to park.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:07 PM
But yeah.  Well, okay. So and then, you know, if I were gonna, if if it were going to be that I could make this happen, I'd have to go find people who had the equipment and the capability to do it, right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:08 PM
 And so my my need out of it. Let's say so.  the um,  the Amazon facility that we're doing in Witchita pays $1,000 a month.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:08 PM
 Are you guys doing snow removal on that or mowing?

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:08 PM
 Yes, that's yes. No removal.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:08 PM
 So, where are we getting the equipment for the Witchita 1?

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:08 PM
 Chris found a private investor, his name's Buck. This guy is an old dog and he makes private loans to small businesses and farmers who need a equipment loans. And he's told all the equipment vendors around Witchita. If you have somebody that needs to buy equipment and they can't have them reach out to me. I'll give them a good deal. This guy's doing what home path is doing. But he's just got his own little Pond that he does it in.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:08 PM
Okay. So Chris found Chris found an equipment for the witch's office facility.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:08 PM
 Right. And he  Yes. So this guy's gonna Finance us for all of our snow equipment, all of our snow equipment in Witchita for the brining equipment, and the truck and everything else.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:09 PM
 Do you have people to do it to work it? You have employees.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:09 PM
 Uh, we will. Yeah. We will the the equipment setup that we're the equipment setup that we're doing, is going to require a lot less labor than normal.

(316) 573-5120 | Oct 12, 2025 08:09 PM
Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 12, 2025 08:09 PM
 so,  Yeah.  but,  Just, anyway, so that's where I'm at. I would have to

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:32 PM
Hello.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:32 PM
Hey, Dustin. This is Andy.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:32 PM
 Hey Andy. How's it going?

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:32 PM
 Good good. I called you from the wrong number. I'm actually a I'm actually a fractional CFO for a company that my cousin owns and uh that 316 number came from that line.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:32 PM
 Oh okay. I was like who I don't know who that is.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:32 PM
 Yeah, no. That was uh I I have a dedicated phone line for that, but I didn't switch over my numbers before I called you. So,

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:32 PM
 It's all good.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:32 PM
 That's yeah, that's what that number was. Um, okay. So what do we what do we got? What are we working on?

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:32 PM
 well, uh like I emailed you um, a couple days ago, basically, what I'm trying to  What what I'm trying to do is see if I can postpone our um, payments for 3 months. Um, put them on a pause and that way uh and gives us you know, the fourth quarter to kind of make sure everything's going to be okay and caught up a little bit and then maybe uh, and then starting them back up in January. Uh, where they're at currently right now?

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:33 PM
 Yeah, yeah. Um, so the first, the first option for reducing the premiums was to was to stop the paid up additions which we've already done that. And so

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:33 PM
 Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:33 PM
 Now, there's not a way to pause premiums because that's just not how it works, right? You're going to be alive every day so they're going to want premiums to cover every day that you're alive.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:33 PM
 Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:33 PM
 But I think we can, I think we can make the premiums go away.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:33 PM
 That makes sense. Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:33 PM
 in effect, if you're willing to be a little bit, finally,  and I would, I would say this, you know, the  Uh, I'm glad we got the debt stuff taken care of, and you guys, can you guys got that working out? I've gotten, you know, uh, confidence in the team that that's working with you guys on that. That'll all get sorted out.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:34 PM
 What I think you should do.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:34 PM
 Yeah, right now. The calls are flooding. Yeah, the the calls are coming in like crazy right now.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:34 PM
 Oh, from all those. From all the debt.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:34 PM
 From.  Yeah, from all the creditors.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:34 PM
 Well that's perfect. Make sure you guys take, take very good notes on anybody. That calls you who they are what they say. And you got to turn every single 1 of those in to Elite legal. That's how they'll that's how they're going to get. That's how they're going to get you out of this is those calls that come in

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:34 PM
 Yeah, I've been, I've been uploading uh, on the email, um, every week. So

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:34 PM
 Yeah.  Okay, yeah, perfect. Yep. No. Do that. Because these these debt collectors? They have no idea. They like they don't know how to follow the law, they just don't. And so if you can catch them in a if you can catch them in a dirty act though, to speak by calling you when they're not supposed to or threatening or anything like that, bam, it's another fine that they have to pay. So um,

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:34 PM
Yeah, right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:34 PM
 Okay, um, I think the best option would be. You've got significant cash value stored up in your accounts. I would say that you take, we, we need to do a calculation figure out what the, what the monthly premium would be, let's pay it up for 6 months.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:35 PM
Using the cash out of the policies.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:35 PM
 Mhm.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:35 PM
 Now, is it a little, right? I here's the thing. I wish you guys would have told me about the credit card stuff, like 2 years ago because I would have told you, you got plenty of money in your policy. Take what you need from their first before you start getting into credit cards, right? And I think that could have that could have avoided that situation, but that's why I like to try. And make sure I really keep up with people at least every 6 months is because a lot of times, the things that, um, the things that seem like a good idea at the time, those aren't the most Optimal Solutions going forward. It doesn't really matter though because you guys, you guys can't mess this up. Like, here's why we built this. We built this in this way, so that in case of an emergency or an opportunity, you guys would have flexibility and control if that makes sense.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:35 PM
Right. Right.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:36 PM
 Yeah, right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:36 PM
 And so I don't want you to, I don't want you to keep going um, with the policy.  Thinking that you can't use it or don't have access to it. I know you just took out money for school. That is perfect. That's exactly what it's supposed to be there for if you guys are in a job transition, right now, that's what it's supposed to be used. For the whole point is that when these life situations come up, that inevitably, they will affect everyone like you guys

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:36 PM
 Guys are not some kind of outlier, there's nothing wrong with you. The reason why I plan things, the way they planned them is because consistently across the board. No matter what age or how long I've had a client, some kind of some kind of something will come up where it interrupts the game plan, right. And I like to have a very wide margin of flexibility so that we can go. Hey you know what, let's just re redirect reallocate switch some things around and most of the time within 12 months or less and 12 months is really stretching it I don't think I've ever had anybody in an emergency situation that couldn't be figured out in less than 3 months. Right? But based on what you guys are doing and your whole game plan going forward, like you're already moving forwards, a way to resolve this situation for yourself.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:36 PM
 Sure.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:37 PM
 Right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:37 PM
 This is the exact kind of situation that you should be willing to go. Okay. We're going to take some cash from our policy. We're not even going to think about paying it back right now, but we're just going to take what we need to get us through this 6-month period, and there you go. That's what it's supposed to be there for now, the old, the ultimate impact of this. And the number 1 thing that I think,

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:37 PM
 Right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:37 PM
 if I had to kind of, um,  Proactively put words to your to what might be going on in your brain right now.  Is the idea that?  Sorry, give me a second. The idea that, you know, well if we take loans, aren't we just obligated to pay them back and that seems to really stress a lot of people out, but I want to make sure that you understand

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:38 PM
Those the cash that's building up in your policy and the loans that you take from there, if you never took them back, they would take it out of the hundreds of thousands of dollars of death benefit. At the end, the way it's structured, you're not going to make the policy blow up right away, right? I've had people that put in a hundred thousand dollars turn around and take it out the next day and they still haven't put a dime back into it, right?

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:38 PM
 Now, we have to be, we have to be kind of, um, we need to be purposeful with that. But at your stage of Life, at your age of life, I don't think there's anything wrong with you guys, taking those policy loans, and making sure that you guys can do what you need to do right now. The poor.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:38 PM
Uh, I don't.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:38 PM
 Write.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:38 PM
 Right.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:38 PM
 Hello. Oh, you broke up.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:39 PM
 Oh I'm sorry. The point shouldn't be that you're sitting on a giant pile of cash with no reason. Right?  You can deploy, you can do deploy that cash to go make more money. I have you guys, if we hadn't had this job changed, you'd probably be ready for that right now. However,

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:39 PM
 Right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:39 PM
 we're going to take it, we're going to allocate some of that so that you can get through the next 6 months, without a lot of stress and anxiety and then start to rebuild. Now, what happens is you guys as the kids grow up and they get out of, they get launched into life. You know, they'll eventually, they'll all be through school. They'll all be, you know, on their own. They'll be making their own money. Yes, parental support. Probably is going to have to go until Thursday.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:39 PM
 No matter what. Right? But the the the the financial impact of having kids in this stage of life, versus when you guys have kids that are out of the house, okay, maybe they still need some support, it's not going to cost you guys what it cost you now to have 3 kids in the house, doing all the activities, all the sports, the size of cars, you have to buy, like, everything about your lives is completely focused on having 3 kids. And having to do everything for them, there will be a period of your career where you don't have kids, but you're not ready to stop working, right? You're going to be productive, you're going to be generative, and it's in that 105 to 10 to 15 year period that we pay back, quote, unquote that you put back all the money that you had to use to get life started with these 3 kids.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:39 PM
 Hope not. But yeah.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:40 PM
 Yeah.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:40 PM
 Right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:40 PM
 Does that make sense? Because if you if you never took this, if you never took these loans and they were just filled up and you guys put yourself under a bunch of stress and oh no, we got to dig ourselves out of the hole because we got into it. Well,

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:40 PM
 Right. Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:41 PM
 When you're 58 or I don't know the exact math. But whenever whenever you're 58 or whatever, and you guys have 7 or 8 or 10 years, left of working,  Where are you going to put all the extra money that you're not spending on kids. There's nowhere to put it so  All things being equal, you're going to have the same amount of money show up in your life insurance policy. But 1 way you get to take from the policy today and relieve some of the stress and pressure of being parents with kids. And as society, that doesn't support having kids. For some reason, like, it's just not built for those of us with children much less multiple children, right? So

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:41 PM
Much less middle class parents who they're like they don't hand over any scholarships whatsoever.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:41 PM
Right. Well, and that's, you know, that's another thing is, if you're if the bulk of your wealth is in life insurance, you're expected family contribution for uh, scholarships is going to be virtually nothing. They will look at that and they'll only be able to take your active income because they can't access life insurance money reliably they can't mandate that you take money from your life insurance to pay for college. So all of that money is going to be set aside on the expected family contribution worksheet when it comes time to apply for college.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:41 PM
Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:41 PM
 So, we can organize things, we can organize things up front. But for now, the pressure relief valve that you're looking for needs to come from the policy. It's that's what it's there for. That's what it's designed for. You're not going to blow it up by taking money out now and saying, you know what 2 years from now we're going to address how we want to put, put put this back and we're only going to do it on a schedule that works for us.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:42 PM
 Right.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:42 PM
 Yeah. Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:42 PM
 Did that make sense?

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:42 PM
 Right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:42 PM
 What do you feel about that?

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:42 PM
 Yeah, it does.  Yeah, no. And that's and you know and that's  Why I even got into this program in the beginning, is because it it seemed like it was be a good.  Uh buffer in case something happened like this and I'm glad I I'm glad I did when I did it, you know. Yeah. Um because you know,

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:42 PM
 Yeah.  Yeah, perfect. Well this is what it's here for.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:42 PM
 Well, so, I mean, if we can so what you were saying in the beginning of kind of calculating what the premiums would be for the next 6 months, uh, and then taken from the the policy basically, that way it's paid and then I don't have to worry about it for the next 6 months, and then we can start it up whenever things get back on track. Um, you know, because that's

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:43 PM
 Exactly.  Yep.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:43 PM
 You know what's that going to be like 8,000, you know, 9,000 maybe? Um,

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:43 PM
 Yeah, something like that.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:43 PM
 You know, that's that's that's taken from the policy because right now I still have I believe it's 45,000 that I could still take on a loan. I believe, I don't know how many loans you can take, but um,

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:43 PM
 As many as you want, you could take 5 dollars a day every day, if you wanted to

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:43 PM
 So so yeah, so I mean, I still have a little bit of buffer there to, to kind of lean on for something, but I'm hoping I don't have to, I'm hoping that once this, this last loan will get us through enough to where I can get everything kind of back on track and, and start paying things off and everything. So no, but

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:43 PM
 Yeah.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:43 PM
 It's a business opportunity but but or if a business opportunity comes up came up or something that I could use that. I mean I'm also keeping that option open too or, or an investment opportunity, but

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:44 PM
 Right.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:44 PM
 um, that I could use it for so,

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:44 PM
 Yeah. So it looks like your it looks like your policy is 650. So 6 months of that would only be 3,900 and we have to calculate what it would be for the girls, but it's not going to be much more than that. So yeah, I would say probably 7 7 or 8 dollars off of that 45.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:44 PM
Clears out the effective premium payment now.  Remember this, those premiums do not go into a black hole. So, as soon as you  Pay those premiums. You already start to have a more available cash value than you did before.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:44 PM
 Yeah, right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:44 PM
 So, but now it's not a good long-term solution, right? We, we all have to be clear about that. You can't just like, take from the policy and spin it back that won't last forever, right? But in a situation where we need 6 months of buffer, this is exactly why we plan out this policy. The way that it is

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:44 PM
Oh yeah, yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:45 PM
 I hope most people don't have to have an adjustment like this, but what I've noticed is in some way shape or form. Most everybody I've worked with has had an unexpected. Oh, shoot, I need $5,000 right now, it might be a sub pump, a septic tank, a radiator, the kid,

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:45 PM
 Crashes, the car, whatever it is.  Almost everybody. I work with has had something like that happen.  And so this conversation is pretty familiar to me. It's like no, no, no, it's okay to access that money. It's your money. You need to use it right now because the alternative is that you get thrown into this debt. Spiral that then you start taking loans and borrowing and then, no, we don't want any of that. You guys are the source of your own Capital right now, and you have at least 45,000 dollars a little bit more than what the kids policies, but at least 45,000 that, you know, you're in control of you will control the paybacks, you will.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:45 PM
 Control the schedule, right? 6 months from. Now, let's say we turn everything back on and you guys say, well, we can do the premiums, but we're not really going to do the. We're not going to do a Payback right now. Totally fine. Nobody's gonna question you on that, nobody's going to report to the credit bureaus. Nobody's gonna call in your mortgage. If you don't pay back, your life insurance policy loan.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:46 PM
 Right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:46 PM
 so,

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:46 PM
 And I and I already know this but I want to confirm with you. So at the end of the year um you know like for tax purposes, since this is a loan, this isn't considered uh income that we have acred throughout the year.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:46 PM
 Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:46 PM
 Zero reporting to the IRS. They don't even report that you took a loan.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:46 PM
 Yeah.  Okay. And and I'm I'm and I know that I just wanted to reaffirm

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:46 PM
 Yeah, no, no no. I I I get you there. But yeah, you guys can take you can take all of this cash and it is not going to be reportable to the IRS. You don't even, there's not even a spot on your return to let the IRS know that you took a loan like that. It doesn't even make sense.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:46 PM
 Yeah, because it is a loan, yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:46 PM
 Right. Yeah. Loans loan loans are not considered income. And so what just like, you've already kind of used it before. We'll send you a letter saying how do you want to pay this back? They have to send that letter because there needs to be a paper trail that it is a loan with an expectation of payback, but that's the only time they will ever ask for money back on the loan.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:46 PM
 Right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:47 PM
 They send you a statement every year that says, this is how much the loan interest is. And if you want, if not, whatever it just gets added to the, to the whole, back to the, the balance of the loan inside the policy and what eventually you guys will come up with some kind of pay payback, schedule? And I don't want you to think of it as a payback schedule, any more than you would say. Hey, we had 45,000 in a savings account, we drew it down when we had to change careers, but now we're going to build our savings account back up. That? That's how you should look at that.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:47 PM
 Okay.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:47 PM
Right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:47 PM
But again, it'll all be on your schedule. And that's I think where most people get in trouble is when they have payments that are forced it on them that they don't have control over when and where, and how much

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:48 PM
 Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:48 PM
 so,

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:48 PM
 like the

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:48 PM
 Yeah, yeah. So um

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:48 PM
 Yeah. Well, I mean, and it's embarrassing, we have that much. But I mean, we've had just so much. We were just talking this last 2, and a half years has been insane. So, well, we should have, we should have leaned on you and probably leaned on our loans a little bit more. But also, I kind of

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:48 PM
 well yeah.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:48 PM
 you know, I I  you know, I had this in the back of my head that if something did go, you know, arrived with our business that because, you know, things happen in in medical billing and just like it did we helped them get created or helped them grow really good. And then, uh, another bigger company bought them out and then they don't need us anymore. So that's just how that's just how it happens in a medical building world. So yeah. I kind of wanted to keep a buffer in the in our pocket just in case this did happen and then here it is. So

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:48 PM
 Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I think it was. I think it was smart of you guys and just so you know, like we're we're like What are we like 5 or 6 years into this game plan?

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:48 PM
 you know, it's

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:49 PM
 Not even that much probably. Yeah, we we started working together like 2020, I think 2019 2020. Um,

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:49 PM
 Yeah. Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:49 PM
 As you guys get this.  I'm just gonna call it a hiccup, a speed bump. I'm sure that for both of you, it feels very like, oh my God, we're about to make a Monumental shift and like, we're gonna have to figure out a new way of doing and being, okay. That's true. That is true. But I will take, I will say this over the Long Haul, which is kind of. Because of, because I do this every day with people, my brain has kind of shifted to longer terms of thinking, right, from my perspective and how I'm looking at

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:49 PM
No, right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:49 PM
 Your numbers. This is a hiccup, it's a speed bump. You guys will totally come through it and it's going to be fine. And we we made enough space to allow you guys to do this without having to bottom out and have zero cash available, right? Um, because even if you pay up the premiums for 6 months, you're still going to have 35,000 that you can access and so 4 months from now. If you need a little bit more let's go ahead and do that to get you through what you need to get through. You have lots of years of productivity left and I will say this,

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:50 PM
 When you guys get stability.  The first thing that we should do is we should make sure that we are able to deploy the cash that you've built up from the life insurance and start making someone else pay back the loans that you had to take to get through this period. Then even those paybacks that are going back into your own pocket. Don't have to come from your personal productive efforts and that's how we get the snowball going. You do that for a 10-year period, you'll never be in a situation like this again. Someone else will always be putting more income into your pocket, then you're going to have to

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:50 PM
So I have some other tricks that I can pull for you guys, but right now, none of those really matter. The most important thing is you have the liquidity, you have the cash, you have the flexibility and you're in control, you should use it if you need it.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:51 PM
Yeah, yeah yeah exactly. And then you know, is this we're going to be shifting my company to be you know, dissolved and then it will just be me as self-control and then he's looking actively looking for something that's more under his wheelhouse. And I mean it I think in the next especially the last quarter of the year and switching everything and then holidays, it will be so smart to

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:51 PM
 Yeah.  Oh yes. Yeah. And there's going to be a lot of stuff that's going to take your guys's time and attention. We might as well just do this. And and you know what? Dustin, if you get a great job in, you know,

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:51 PM
 November 30th, right? And the paycheck start coming in, you can just uh, restart those premiums right away, too. Like, you're not really locked into anything. I think we just set 6.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:51 PM
 Months is like, hey let's get it taken care of. So you guys can focus on what you need to focus on. But if you don't need the whole

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:52 PM
 Time.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:52 PM
 you could out just yeah, you cut out.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:52 PM
 I'm sorry about that. I was actually driving on my way home from another meeting, so I'm still in the car so it might have that. I was just saying you guys, you guys don't have to take the whole 6 months, if you determine 3 or 4 months in that you, you feel like you're on Solid ground. And you want to restart those premiums? We'll just, we can just go ahead and do that. That's not a big deal. Um,

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:52 PM
Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:52 PM
 So, um, like I said, my, my old goal for you guys with this plan is to have flexibility and control when you need it. Clearly, you need it right now. So let's take it.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:52 PM
 Yeah.  Right, right. Yeah.  Yeah, so how do we uh, how do I go, uh, about doing that?

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:52 PM
 so,  So you took a loan just recently, did you do that online through your portal?

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:52 PM
 Yes.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:52 PM
 Okay, and did the eft, the money directly to the direct deposit it to you.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:52 PM
 Yes.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:52 PM
 Great. So just go in the portal and and uh, you know, submit another amount of policy loan. Um, when I get back to my office, I can send you a text with the total value of all the premiums for the next 6 months. And you can take a policy loan on that, uh, value. And then once it hits your bank account, just go back into the portal and make a premium payment.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:53 PM
 Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:53 PM
 On each policy.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:53 PM
 And that that large premium payment.  Won't won't uh, make it like an endowment or anything like that. Or

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:53 PM
 Nope. No. Because it's, it'll be, it'll be designated towards what's called a semiannual premium. And so I'm going to when I get home. I'll I'll figure out what those exact numbers are, but they'll apply it to the premium and it it comes along um when it's paid as a premium, right? Because technically you guys could do an annual premium, you could pay the whole year up all at once.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:53 PM
 Oh, okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:53 PM
That amount whatever that amount is is still inside all of the lines for taxes. So they don't care. If you pay it monthly quarterly by annually or annually. You can do whatever you like.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:54 PM
 And it it's all going to automatically stay inside those lines.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:54 PM
Okay.  And then that that'll just be another smaller loan that will need to eventually pay back too, right?

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:54 PM
 Correct.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:54 PM
 Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:54 PM
 In the same way that if you had a thousand dollar savings account and you took 000 from it, you should want to add 10,000 more dollars to your savings account over time.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:54 PM
 Right. Right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:54 PM
 That's how that's how you should think about.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:54 PM
 No, I get it. Um,  yeah, yeah. And and that's fine. Um,  yeah, I mean that that's  I mean, that's the way to do it and still kind of  Still everything be fine and that's the way we need to do it.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:54 PM
 Yeah, and just to make sure you remember, right? Even if you never paid those loans back. What do you guys now? Early 40s?

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:54 PM
 45.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:54 PM
 45. Okay, so even if you never even if you, even if you didn't get to that even if you didn't get to making any payments on those loans,

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:55 PM
 Until you were 60 years old.  And you had a lot of extra cash when you're 60, because you're further along in your career, as the kids are out of the house, you just take the extra cash. And instead of being like other 60 year olds who show up to me and they go gosh I'm 60, I really should start planning for retirement. I'm going to catch up. You guys will have a bucket open and ready to accept money that can then grow tax-free.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:55 PM
 You will already have a pre-existing bucket to put that money into whereas and this is a little bit explaining to you how I realized mathematically that this could work.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:55 PM
 Is that if a 60 year old, comes to me, and they don't have a policy and they go, oh gosh, I wish I would have started this 20 years ago. I started realizing if I'm working with 40 year olds who are starting the policy 20 years earlier, but they need the money because their lives exist. Now then when, when you guys get to 60 versus when the person who is 60 now that hasn't ever had a policy that person who's 60 has to start from zero and they're limited to how much they can put in. But you guys at 60. Yeah, you come to the table with a bunch of outstanding policy loans, all the money that you would that you would have had extra at 60 years old. Now, goes into that policy loan.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:56 PM
 And it grows even faster because you booked these 20 years old.  Does that I know it sounds kind of circular? But does that make sense?

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:56 PM
 Right.  Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah. Do you did, maybe Dustin did this on the very beginning? And I wasn't really, I was just like, in la la land with all this. But, um,

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:56 PM
 Did we is there like a financial needs analysis or something that you guys do to visual see like, okay, this is where we're at now. That's where we want to be when we're retired.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:57 PM
Uh, huh. yes, and

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:57 PM
And we're on the right track.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:57 PM
 Yes, absolutely. There is a 4 cat that we got. And I I really should  I don't want to tell you guys that we have to do it in order to have these conversations. I would prefer it if you guys had it so that we can have these conversations with the numbers.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:57 PM
 I think generally I'm correct about what I'm telling you, just because I've done this so much, but I think there's value in US putting the numbers in so you can see. Here's scenario 1, take no policy Loans, pay everything back on your own. Take on the, the burden and the shame that the system is put on to you. And you guys, you know, really tough it out, right? And we'll see what the numbers look like there and then we do a second scenario and this is very comprehensive. I mean we're talking about expenses taxes inflation. Like we want to look at every angle so that you guys know, beyond a shadow of a doubt at 72. Here's how many funds I have and we can project that like, literally month by month where you can go in at 2336, you know, June of 2036. What is our monthly cash flow? Look like, where is it coming from? How is it grown? Yes, I love to have all those questions. So I will send you guys the the link to that so that you can get logged in.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:57 PM
 Yeah.  Oh yeah, for sure.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:57 PM
 Yeah.  Yeah.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:58 PM
 Okay.  Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:58 PM
 Yes. And whenever whenever you get extra time or brain capacity, if you want to just go fill out some of the basics on that the expense plan, make sure the assets are in there. You know the payment through Elite legal, let's keep track of that and make sure that you know that's not completely what you guys out.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:58 PM
 Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:58 PM
 But yes, I'm glad you asked.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:58 PM
 I would like that. I mean, we started with we started when we were 20 before, we had a first dog in America.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:58 PM
 Uhuh.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:58 PM
 You know learned about financial needs and of obviously is just 1 shoe fits all and it's term and that's why we have that Term Policy. But  I would like to, you know, learn more and Visually see, I'm a visual person and just kind of you know just see you are are we on the right track? Are we not on the right track? What

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:58 PM
 Yes.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:58 PM
 You know.  I mean, I know we are in the right track, but

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:59 PM
 Yep.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:59 PM
 so,  Anyway, so yeah, that would be great. We would love to do that.  You're kind of cutting out again. Sorry. But

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:59 PM
 Yes.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:59 PM
 yeah, you're if you can hear me, you're cutting out.  We can't hear you.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:59 PM
 Yes.  Well and it's it always is fun and it's encouraging right? Because especially when there we go are you are you okay? That's

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:59 PM
 Hello.  Hang up and call back.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:59 PM
 Can you hear me now?

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:59 PM
 Okay. Okay, now we can hear you.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:59 PM
 Dustin. Yeah, guys, I got home and I went to walk into my office. I left the phone in the car, but I was on my airpods.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 01:59 PM
 oh, oh, we're like, um,

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 01:59 PM
Yes um yes. So the forecast I will send you a link to that when you guys go in there if you just as you have time fill out the you know different parts of the financial plan. There's expenses, there's assets, there's debts, all that stuff, you know if you have questions, let me know. I know you guys are busy so 1 of the things that I found works really well.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 02:00 PM
Is I can create a video of you know, going through the analyzer or whatever and I can share the video with you guys so that you guys can watch it on your own time. We don't always have to connect

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 02:00 PM
Yeah, yeah. Okay. For sure that we can definitely do that.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 02:00 PM
 Yeah, I I agree with you Laura, though. There should be a way for you to visually see how it's going and you know, these are the decisions we've made. How does that impact us? 5 10, 15, 20 years out? Yeah.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 02:00 PM
 Yes.  Yeah, exactly.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 02:00 PM
 Yep, no I I agree with you.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 02:00 PM
 And what do we want to do in the next few years? To make sure we get to where we need to be, and things like that. So,

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 02:00 PM
 Yeah. And as you guys are going through that, I would also encourage you. If you have expenses that are coming up that you know, you know, if there's School expenses that you know, you're gonna have to pay for if your fence needs repaired, if you got to purchase a new car, if there's anything like that on the horizon, go ahead and put it all in there. Because a lot of times, if I know about it, I will plan your game plan around it. And I'll say, hey, I figured out how to take this pot of money over here and bring in this income. So that, when you guys are ready to get this loan, the loan is covered 80% by the income from this other spot and your actual payment for your car is only going to be 120 instead of 450. If I know about it, I'll start rearranging things like my brain can't help it. I'll just rearrange things and be like, oh hey, I fixed this problem for you. That was going to come up in 3 years.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 02:01 PM
Well, I guarantee the car thing is going to come up. I'm driving a we're, everything's paid off right now, but that van is like,

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 02:01 PM
Yeah.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 02:01 PM
 And someday, I just the van is fine.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 02:01 PM
 Yeah, uh, oh. All right. You guys talk about that and then you let me know,

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 02:01 PM
 Yeah, plug in the number.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 02:01 PM
 um,  Yes. Yeah. No. I I agree. Let's get those numbers out. I, you know, it's something that I try to encourage our conversations to be around, but I know you guys are, you guys got a lot going on? So if we don't get it, it's not like this week, but I think over the next 2 to 3 years, if we can start relying on that tool to mathematically, verify my ideas, your anxieties. Let's get all those out on paper so we can see and then it gives us a framework for how do you make a decision? Should we take money from the policy? Should we get a loan? I don't know. Let's see which 1 leaves the most amount of money in your pocket.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 02:02 PM
Yeah.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 02:02 PM
 Yeah.  Yeah well and that's why I told him. I said, you really we got 3 daughters that are growing into adult hood. You know what? The next thing is gonna be hey

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 02:02 PM
 Oh boy. Yeah, right. Yeah.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 02:02 PM
 We're getting married. You know? Like we have some time for that but, you know, it's just

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 02:02 PM
 Yeah. Yeah.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 02:02 PM
 I told them to get married for another 10 years, so,

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 02:02 PM
 Right. Just just hold off on that. I'm I'm telling my kids. Like, don't make it a rush. You don't need to rush into that decision. Be really sure. And if it takes you till your 30, that's totally. Okay. I need time to recover. I need time to recover from the grocery.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 02:03 PM
 Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 02:03 PM
 You guys are giving me.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 02:03 PM
 Yeah, exactly.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 02:03 PM
 So, um, but yeah, go ahead and go ahead and request the loan. I'm gonna go look up the numbers right now. I might have to call them and get uh, get the 6-month numbers. If you guys want to do a 6-month pay up and I will find all that out and then I'll text you and then practically all, you do request the loan. Once the funds hit your bank account, turn around, go back on the portal and make a premium payment for each of the, um, for each of the policies with the numbers. I give you, and then that should take care of it for the next 6 months.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 02:03 PM
 so,

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 02:03 PM
 Okay. Yeah. That that sounds like a good idea, so I appreciate it.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 02:03 PM
Heck yeah. All right. You guys have a great afternoon. Call me if you need anything. Um, I'll be in touch.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 02:03 PM
All right. Sounds good. Thanks Sandy. Appreciate it.

Andy Daniels | Oct 10, 2025 02:03 PM
 All right. Yep. Have a good day. Bye.

(702) 985-2025 | Oct 10, 2025 02:03 PM
 All right, you

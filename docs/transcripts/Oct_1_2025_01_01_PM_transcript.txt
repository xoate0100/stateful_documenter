Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:02 PM
 Oh,  Yeah, yeah, I don't know, we just kind of missed uh missed spots there, but it's all good. We're connected now.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:02 PM
 So yeah, so I got laid off unexpectedly.  Um, probably gonna take me a while to get.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:02 PM
 Well that's that's usually how late work.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:02 PM
 What's that?

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:02 PM
 I said that kind of how layoffs work.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:02 PM
 Yeah, man. So  Excuse me.  I got a allergies need to see when I can do on this, uh, you know, on the springing.  And uh, because it'll probably take me a little while to get get a job.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:02 PM
 Yeah, yeah. Well that's why we  Write no worries. Um we built in some flexibility there on purpose because I know that life happens. So so

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:02 PM
 Okay, okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:02 PM
 um,  let's take a look. I'm pulling up your policy now. Um,

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:02 PM
 Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:02 PM
 give me 2 seconds here.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:02 PM
 Yep.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:03 PM
 Okay, so  Right now.  We are at.  Okay, we're at 89894. Is that what's coming out of your account? Every month, right?

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:03 PM
Uh, actually 50 more on top of that. As a as my loan Payback,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:03 PM
 Okay, you've got a loan, payback processing.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:03 PM
 Excuse me, my goodness.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:03 PM
 so, our first  First thing we could do is we could stop the loan pay back, right? I get it back down to 898.  Uh, let me check 1 second real quick.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:03 PM
 Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:03 PM
 Okay, you just have a policy anniversary on September 11th. So  um,  we're into a new policy here.  Um,  So, here's an interesting thought, so we've got some leeway on this. We we had already taken down your page. Editions kind of down to the minimum.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:04 PM
 Um,  but here's the good news and this might be something we kind of you know, touch base with every couple of weeks  So, you're last premium already got sent in on September 28th.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:04 PM
Actually, they just took another 1 yesterday, or the day, 10 10 1. They just took another 1 out.  They just took they just took another 1 101.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:04 PM
Okay.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:04 PM
 Which is today.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:04 PM
 Right. They must have they must have initiated at the beginning of the week and it just hit your bank account today.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:04 PM
 This morning.  Correct, there you go.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:04 PM
 okay, so that that  gone, we can't get it back, but

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:04 PM
 Now I understand and there's no rib. We're good, we're good.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:04 PM
 okay, the good news is the next The next premiums not due and until or won't come out. And until  The end of October. So we've got 4, 4 4 straight weeks. Um, what do you think about the prospects of jobs between now and then?

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:05 PM
Probably not going to happen. My my my level of position takes you to a couple of months to win it a good job.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:05 PM
 Okay. Okay. Okay.  The.  Second. So then the second option is We, There is some loan value available because you've been putting that back  And so my preferred option. Before we start before we start, really slicing and dicing in here is I think we can get it. We can get it out to about.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:05 PM
 Oh, hold on, Roger, give me a second. Give me just a second.  I think I've got there's 1 piece that I'm not that I'm not remembering but I need to include here.  That might make this thing work beautifully.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:05 PM
 Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:05 PM
 I've got a lot into a different spot though.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:05 PM
 Now you go ahead, I'm good.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:05 PM
 It's probably gonna have me too.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:06 PM
 Allergies really bad for some reason. Mine good.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:06 PM
 Oh no. Oh, that time of year, right?

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:06 PM
 Terrible. Yep.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:06 PM
 Everything's kind of shedding off for the winter time.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:06 PM
 Yes, sir.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:06 PM
 All right. Sorry. It's uh, it is making me do a 2 Factor authentication here.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:06 PM
 All right. It's it's thinking about it. It's going to decide if it like my code or not.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:06 PM
 Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:06 PM
 There we go.  There we go. That's what I want to see. All right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:06 PM
 Oh my gosh. Roger Roger.  Roger.  I got some good news for you.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:06 PM
 Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:07 PM
 It's all gonna be.  Have.  27,000 of cash in your

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:07 PM
 In my eye.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:07 PM
 Do you remember about that?  Yeah, did you remember about that?

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:07 PM
 I knew I had some in there but I, yeah, I do. Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:07 PM
 Yeah, so you you you put in 100 we we put 145,000 into that home path note and it kicks off interest every month.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:07 PM
Yes.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:07 PM
 So that that interest has just been sitting in the cash account growing up every month.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:07 PM
 Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:07 PM
 And so you've got from 145 to 172?

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:07 PM
 Wow. Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:07 PM
 Since we did that.  Which is that's nuts.  That is awesome.  So here's what I propose, here's what I propose we do because I don't think this is the kind of thing that we need to necessarily. We don't need to necessarily to take action today other than I can call at and I can tell them to stop the fifty dollar loan payment. I think we should that for the moment.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:08 PM
 I mean that's only 50 bucks, dude. I don't think we need to do that.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:08 PM
Okay.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:08 PM
I don't I don't I don't see any reason to do that. I mean if we can't do anything better than that, that's that's not. I make it work.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:08 PM
 What?  Okay.  Okay.  So here's, here's what we should do. Um, we should on October  20th the week of October 20th, right? Right. That's 1 2 3, 3 weeks that's 3 weeks away and I'm gonna hold on I'm gonna set a calendar.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:08 PM
 Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:09 PM
 Appointment, uh, up for this.  um,  we should have another chat.  We should talk about. Okay. Do we think that we can make that premium for October out of your current cash flow if not no big deal? You can just say hey nope. Let's let's execute the game plan.  What we'll do is we'll uh we'll go to. We'll go to direct IRA and we'll request a distribution for the exact amount of the Lafayette premium that's coming out.  and,  Home path is a effectively to pay your premium until you get your job back.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:09 PM
 No, I get it, get it so excuse me that's that's good strategy. But I need to do something a little more  Because I'm going to need some funds. I'm going to need funds to survive on.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:09 PM
 Okay.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:09 PM
 For the next couple of months. So

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:09 PM
 Okay.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:09 PM
 What I want to do, I think I prefer to do this. Let's go to the, uh,  Good lord. I can't even talk, man.  Let's go to the uh, IRA and let me get just a, a lump sum distribution.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:09 PM
 No worries.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:09 PM
 And what I don't need or don't use off of back in there.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:09 PM
 Okay.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:09 PM
 I'm thinking like I'm thinking, like 10 grand.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:09 PM
 Okay. I would I would do it a little more. I would be really conservative about that because every dollar we take out is going to be taxable and you can't really put it back.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:09 PM
 Well, I mean, I can, I know I can't put well, I mean, I lose the tags. That's, that's that's a given, but I can put, I can put money back in there towards the, uh, original. Right?

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:10 PM
Right. Yes. But now write the amount of money that you can put back is limited and it's not going to be the same. It's going to count as a new contribution which kind of changes the tax status of that money going forward. So

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:10 PM
 um,  Don't, I guess don't overshoot it. I guess is what I'm saying, um, far far better.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:10 PM
 No, I don't want to overheat it but but I don't have any income coming in 000, Sonata and I have to have something that I'm gonna sink if I don't.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:10 PM
 Okay.  Yeah.  Well.  Yeah. Well, let's do it. Do you have a log in? You have a login to drive? Did I

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:10 PM
uh,  I did let me look real quick. Hold on, let me look because I've been having issues with that and I don't remember if I got a resolved and

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:10 PM
 so they, they switched over to a brand new, they switched over to a brand new

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:10 PM
 yeah, I know, I didn't miss my whole thing up because  They they put an old email address that I no longer use or no longer have access to and they can't seem. They had a very difficult working around me, let me let me log in to see if I don't remember if I got it fixed or not.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:11 PM
 Well, okay. Okay, okay, you should be able to complete.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:11 PM
Hello.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:11 PM
 You should be able to.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:11 PM
 If not.  They they sent me something. No know what they said to all they can do.  If I didn't already get it fixed, I got to send me hard paper in the mail. I have to submit that and all this BS to get it fixed. It's

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:11 PM
 well, let me call, let me call, let me call them because the other thing is they they want

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:11 PM
 I don't know.  Hold on, hold on. Let me confirm, let me make. Let me see where I'm at. Hold on. Just a second.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:11 PM
 Yeah.  No worries.  No worries.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:11 PM
 And just a second here, tonight wasn't planning on pulling all this up, so bear with me.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:11 PM
 Yep. Yep, yep. If you have to 2

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:11 PM
 Yeah, I got it. So hold on just a second. Uh first uh,

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:12 PM
 Yeah.  This is happening to me, so life is something.  You never know what you're gonna get out of it, that's for sure.  Yes.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:12 PM
Oh Roger, this is even better. How, how old are you now?

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:12 PM
 Yeah.  That's it.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:12 PM
 How old are you now?

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:12 PM
 60 of 60.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:12 PM
 60, guess what you're over 59 and a half. There's not gonna be a penalty for that with, for that distribution.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:12 PM
 60.  Correct now. Yeah, I do that but I still have to pay the tax burden but I mean I would have to do that anyway.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:12 PM
 Yes, but you don't have to worry about that until next April.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:12 PM
 No, you're right that.  Correct. Correct, correct, correct. So hold on. Let me still get into this.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:12 PM
 So,  When you're filling out, when you're filling out.  Yeah, when you fill it out those distribution forms make sure you select do not withhold taxes.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:12 PM
 Got it, understood.  All right, hold on. Just a second. I'm getting that.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:12 PM
 Now Technically when we hit 25,000, we were supposed to roll that into a new note and get more money. But I mean this this is what it's supposed to be there for. So we'll just we'll just revise your plan slightly and um we'll roll with it.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:13 PM
 Understood. Um yeah. Hold on let me get all this pulled up here. Hold on a second.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:13 PM
 Sure, sure. Sure.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:13 PM
 And then we'll talk.  Yeah, I should have already had all this answered. I didn't, I wasn't even thinking about accessing this so just bear with me.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:13 PM
 I didn't I hadn't even looked at your IRA, but when I texted you that I got a plan, I knew that I made a contingency somewhere for something like this to happen.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:13 PM
Yeah, there we go.  It gets Reverend load, of course, because I want to look at it now, uh,  Let's see, let's see. Let's see, let's see.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:14 PM
 Let's see, let's see. There we go. Found it found me. Open it up. Yeah, I may have already corrected, I just don't remember. It's just so much going on all the time. Um,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:14 PM
okay, yeah, I know where

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:14 PM
 But if not I'll I'll know here in just a second. Let me see.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:14 PM
 I can also I can also call them and try to help out. I think if that if that would help.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:14 PM
 Yeah, we need to if we need to hear but I may have already done it. All is what I'm getting at. I may have already got a resolved so just and I don't want to go through all that if I did. But I I I'll know here in just 1 more second.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:14 PM
 Yeah, no, that's perfect.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:15 PM
 All right.  I don't know, all we can do is let me. Let's try.  Let let me try to log into it right quick.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:15 PM
Sure.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:15 PM
 With, with the information that I have saved.  Right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:15 PM
 Okay. Yeah.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:15 PM
 So it's direct ira.com, right?

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:15 PM
 Yeah, directed ira.com.  and,  Yeah.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:15 PM
Hold on.  Let me see that. I don't know. It seems like I did get it resolved but I can't just let me just let me do what I got to do here. And I'll I'll I'll you'll know here in a minute.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:15 PM
 Yeah, yep. Yep. Yep.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:15 PM
 You all both remember, I'll remember, you'll know. Okay, I'm gonna try to log in using the login that I had.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:16 PM
 No, it doesn't it doesn't like anything that I put in there.  s***. Remember,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:16 PM
okay, let me, um,  Yeah, let me call the direction. Um I might have the distribution for a pdf version of it in which case um I can send you electronic uh electronic signature so that we can get that done in. Um and you want you want to do 10,000 with that help you feel good for the next couple months.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:16 PM
 Okay.  Yes, I think so. I think that would be plenty.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:17 PM
 Okay.  Let's just yeah, let's just do it. We'll figure out. We'll figure out what needs to get done. You, you got that? You got money. Build up.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:17 PM
 And what I would do since you can't postpone my premiums or anything there's and then they won't let me put like, A month or 2 of premiums on the back end. They won't let me do nothing like that.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:17 PM
 What do you mean by that?

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:17 PM
 so, in other words instead of paying November and December,  Take those 2 payments and put them on the very end of all my payments. Then we'll do something like like a like a a mortgage company does

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:17 PM
Um, well, no, because there's not there's not an end date, right? The end of the end of your life, so it's not like there's a, yeah, it's not like there's a balance that you're paying down. Um, I do have some more levers that I can pull.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:17 PM
 okay, okay, I got it.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:17 PM
 But you know, their 1600 dollars available in the policies. So worst case scenario that gets you an additional 2 months by just taking the policy low.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:17 PM
 Got it. I understand.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:18 PM
 so, you know, if we get to 10,000, you still got  17,000 left in your IRA. There's 1600 in the policy. I think that's  That should be enough to limp along for.  at least the next 4 or 5 months, even 6 months if we needed to

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:18 PM
 Yeah. Yeah. We don't want to go that long. I I I'm confident.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:18 PM
 No.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:18 PM
 I'm confident, I'll have it wrapped up in a couple of months.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:18 PM
 um,  yeah, you know, the last time this happened, I the reason I asked about a couple of weeks is the last time this happened. You, you were like, split. You had a new job. Like, 2 weeks later.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:18 PM
 Oh yeah. Yeah, which was which yeah, which was which was very unusual. And and yeah, so we're good. I mean it's I'll get something I got I just need I want a little cushion right now. I'm trying to take all the pressure off and then I'll so I can look

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:18 PM
 Okay.  Don't worry.  Yeah.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:18 PM
 Not just take something that's that's because I'm desperate. You know what I mean?

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:18 PM
 Right. Oh yeah. No, I understand. This is why we set this up this way because I I I've been around the block stuff like this happen and you should have the flexibility to do what you need to do.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:19 PM
 Perfect.  So anyway, um yeah, you want to you, so what's your plan you want to? Will you call them initiate all of this and then  Send me what I need, or whatever.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:19 PM
Yes, I'm gonna try. Yeah. And I'm gonna try and get them to to fix up your um, your login too. Now, what's your, um,

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:19 PM
 To sign.  Yeah.  Now they they they've got paperwork on the way in the mail. They said, the only way they can fix this is I have to do it in my hard paper, copy and submitted and all that junk. And that's, that's all it's only, it's all they could do.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:19 PM
 what's your new email?

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:19 PM
 Okay. Well, what's your, what's your new email address?

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:19 PM
 And I've got all that coming and honest way to fix to fix that piece of it.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:19 PM
 okay, well, give me the new address because I might

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:19 PM
 Because they told me that I would have to get on online, I'd have to get online to get this. Uh,  This this, uh, distribution form. They said they only have them online now.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:19 PM
 Write.  Yep. That's yeah, that's generally pretty true. Um,

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:19 PM
 Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:19 PM
 Let me, what's your new email address that you want to get changed to?

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:20 PM
 It's uh, you ready?  K.  E.  H.  E.  Now n o w.  At yahoo.com.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:20 PM
 Okay, k e. H e. That's kilo. Edgar Hotel edirne. Nancy. Oscar whiskey.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:20 PM
That is correct at yahoo.com.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:20 PM
Okay, got it.  Um, I'm also going to resend the invitation to your portal, uh, for our uh, analyzer because we need to be using that to uh track all the stuff.  and um,  I'll send that over to you so we can have that. And then, you know, once this all settles down, let's uh, Let's do, let's do a proper review and make sure that, you know, stuff still, where you want it to be. We're still looking along where we need to go.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:20 PM
 Oh no. Absolutely. And and I had intended to do this before this.  Happened. So, let's get this navigated and then we'll revisit. So, um, I'm down to, I'm down to a very small amount of money.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:21 PM
 okay, I was just  I was just talking to a lady.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:21 PM
 I'm down to a small amount of money. So let's get this disbursement.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:21 PM
 Yeah.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:21 PM
 On its way as quickly as we can. Please sir.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:21 PM
 Yeah, we'll make that the priority. Um, I've got a look up and see if I have the paper. Uh, the paper or the um  The non online versions of the forms. I'm pretty sure I do because I kind of, I kind of hoarded those forms when they started switching everything over because I do stuff like

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:21 PM
 There you go and they may let you use them, you know? So no anything you can do.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:21 PM
 This would happen guys. We

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:21 PM
 Now, excuse me.  My.  Um yeah. I mean if we can get that rolling as quickly as possible, I think I'll be okay. It was have what I was thinking. Let's say that, let's say that boom. I got something going in 2 weeks again.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:22 PM
 Well then I just turn around and put that money right back in there.  Right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:22 PM
 perfect.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:22 PM
 I mean, right?

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:22 PM
 Uh, yes, I have to make sure that they they will allow that um, from the IRA if it's within 60 days. I think we have a good case for it.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:22 PM
 um, sometimes if

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:22 PM
 Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:22 PM
 It's a sometimes if it's in um 60 days. Um there are some Provisions that allow you to kind of put it back.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:22 PM
 All right, all right, but then let's let's look at this option, let's say that. Let's just say, I don't need it, that I can put it all back in my life. My life, my life account.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:22 PM
 Exactly. And I would say if you just take it out of the IR, don't worry about putting it back in the ira, you should just put it back in the Life Insurance.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:22 PM
 so, I'm going  There you go. I mean and it's and either way is is is, which is something I want to talk. Let me ask you this kind of what's on my mind. So here's all right. So here's what happened. I had a good job.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:22 PM
 They're 2 years, but they weren't, I wouldn't make it enough money. I mean, we were we were struggling to make ends meet all my bills went up.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:22 PM
 Yeah.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:23 PM
 I lost my second job and blah blah blah.  So, the reason I went for this job that, I just got laid off on because they paid me, they offered me. Uh,  A considerable more money per year and with that amount I was going to be able to do some really amazing things and then I get laid off too much later. So there you go. Anyway Here's my thought. You tell me if I'm thinking we're all

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:23 PM
Okay.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:23 PM
Like let's just say between now and 8 more years, let's just just just throw that out.  My thought and my plan was to throw as much money as I can into both the life plan and pay off that 50,000. You know, towards that 50,000 debt,

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:23 PM
 because that goes back to me, and  Into my IRA and get as many of those 25,000 you know opportunities as I can muster in the next 8 years instead of using 401k or any other interests. But I felt like if I were to max out both of those opportunities, I should be setting very, very good. And I'm talking about if I could put

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:24 PM
 You know if everything would have worked out with this a job I had I could have probably easily put 10 or 15 thousand a year towards both of those consistently to the next 8 years. Does that make sense? I thought it on top of what I'm already doing.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:24 PM
 Yes. Yeah.  Right. And I think so I'll do the numbers on.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:24 PM
 Would that be a smart move? Would that be a smart move? Instead of trying to reach and find other instruments?

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:24 PM
 Yeah, absolutely think so other other folks that I've had who get focused in like that. Um I've got a lady who went from 100,000 to 400,000 in the last 8 years, 7 years so

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:24 PM
 Okay.  Boom, that's what I'm talking about.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:24 PM
 You're you're right on there. That's the exact plan. Um,  So but we, but this is just a hiccup. I'm not, I'm not worried looking at the numbers that you've got now. Like okay, we gotta get you the new job and then you get focused on this. We can, we can solve this probably it'll take longer than you want but it'll be quicker than you expect.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:25 PM
Okay, fair enough.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:25 PM
 um,  uh, so yeah, no, I agree with that.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:25 PM
 Well, we won't do anything with the IRA premium, then we'll just keep it as is and I'll just pay it out of that.  You know that 10 grand and yeah we're good because I've got my house payment and everything already postponed for 3 months. They I've got that. I got my truck payment. I got all those big payments postponed.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:25 PM
 Okay.  Yeah.  And just know that.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:25 PM
 And no, no credit hit or anything, so so I should be fine.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:25 PM
 Okay.  Okay. Yeah, no. I mean you you gotta you gotta kind of activate and, you know, shuffle the pieces around until you find the next. The next gig that you're gonna be working. But, um, you know, yeah, even if even if

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:25 PM
 Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:25 PM
 in the worst case scenario, even if it takes 6 months,  I think we've got enough funds to cover the premium, a minimum wage and we can get you covered for a couple of months on on the bills and stuff from your IRA with no penalty. And we're not gonna have withdraw. The taxes is what what we'll do is we'll just say uh when you get the new job

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:26 PM
 On your W4. We'll just have them take out a little bit of extra to cover the, you know, 15 or 18% that you're gonna owe on that distribution. I don't think it'll be that big of a deal.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:26 PM
No, no, 100%. Yeah, not, yeah. I feel confident then. Yeah, and yeah, yeah, no, I agree. I agree. Totally. I think we'll be fine.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:26 PM
 Yeah. Okay let me let me research this um withdrawal form. I'm gonna send you a docu sign. Um today to get that going. Um, do you

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:26 PM
 Okay. Text me when you when you when you need me to go, look at it and find it because I'm gonna be out doing stuff and I'll come in here and get online and get it done.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:26 PM

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:26 PM
 No, I think we're good right now. If you could help me with that, man, I'd appreciate it. I do have it all coming in the mail. I already, you know, had it all rolling, but since you think you might can expedite it, that would be awesome.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:26 PM
 Yeah, if we can do it, if I can set it up for you electronically, then they'll they can process it a lot quicker.

BLACK RODGER    | Oct 1, 2025 01:26 PM

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 01:27 PM

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:40 PM
Hey, now.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:40 PM
Okay. All right, we're back. Sorry she was uh they had just finished up dinner and her her PayPal card that I set her up with was declining and I think it fraud alerted her. So I had to come up with a quick solution.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:40 PM
 You tell me something with them cards and notifications. And I'm, you know, I'm just kind of getting burned out on all this technology, all the replication and the double checking and the, you need to track this and I'm fed up with it.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:40 PM
 I know, right?

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:40 PM
 I know, right? We need to

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:40 PM
 I'm an old dinosaur, man. I just want to do my spreadsheets and leave me the hell alone. You know what I mean? It's like golly.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:40 PM
 We need to make sure that you're not a robot though. What if what, if you're a robot? What do we do? You, you might be a robot.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:40 PM
 Yeah, I know you are not a robot.  God.  Yeah. I know. I'm just sick of that crap though. Anyway, yeah I'm sorry she said that he's not feeling well so she's down on the downstairs. On the cab. Yes she's had a some kind of stomach but I had a bug. I had about a week ago, not see. When was it a week ago? Sunday not this past Sunday but a week ago and I was felt like dog crap, man. It was terrible. You know, couldn't get out of the bathroom and I won't go any more after that. If you know what I mean something going around do Molly was sick and I think Laurel was sick and no I was for a day.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:41 PM
 Yeah.  Um,  Oh, okay.  no, no not  yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:41 PM
 Something happens. Something happens in like September October where that kind of stuff just goes around kind of, before the winter season.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:41 PM
 I know.  Yeah. Yeah.  But uh other than that we're doing okay. Oh I just remembered I got update the analyzer because she's retired now. So I got to do some changing around and then just going on with the shutdown here and the government that's kind of looming over my mind a little bit with that might change some things and a little bit on some of my decisions or whatever. I first want to ask you if I may is using Home Pass, still lucrative.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:42 PM
 Are there other Investments that, you know, do better than Home Path? I don't know what you do. You still push home path? You know I guess you have other clients that you use for it, you know?

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:42 PM
Well.  Yeah, you know, here's the thing. I've got a couple of other, I've got a couple of other providers, but the security piece is not there.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:42 PM
 Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:42 PM
 And so, you know, I've got, I've got a guy that can get us 12%, but it's not a monthly, it's not a monthly payback. That's a 12% growth. So that's more like

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:42 PM
 Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:42 PM
 You stick money away, you don't need anything off of it and 7 years from now you've got a accumulated 12% per year, right? Um

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:42 PM
 Oh, I see. Yeah, yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:42 PM
 so those are those are good, but they're

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:42 PM
 Yeah, I gotta need my money now. You know, or we need our money now?

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:42 PM
 Right. And I think,  Yeah, and I think for what we're trying to do HomePath is still a really good option for um, for getting that monthly payment in and then, you know, filtering it back to your life insurance and then you have that cash available when you need it and you just kind of wash rinse and repeat. And you know what I like about this and what a lot of other of my clients who are in your age group like about this is precisely that it's simple and it's boring.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:43 PM
 Yeah.  Oh yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:43 PM
They don't want flashy.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:43 PM
 Yeah, but I I find it exciting because it's so boring because it's so predictable, like the word, I like to use the word predictable. Yeah, I like the predictability of it. Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:43 PM
 Right. Yes, there you go. Yes. And I  I also like that. And so, um, so know and I, I think as a as a company, um, you know, based on everything that that, you know, we're seeing from them, you know, they put out their little yearly newsletter or whatever. They they have a lot of stuff going on. We're still in a housing market crunch, like there's still an an inventory crunch like uh, there's not enough houses to go around and so

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:43 PM
Oh, really okay. Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:43 PM
 Yeah yeah. So Builders Builders everywhere are in a really good good position because they're just going to keep building with what they got and people have to buy houses. And so um, so this this little

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:44 PM
 And they're still going to turn that cornfield into a, a huge housing division up there on 5901 spring Spring Hill, Road or whatever. Where both of them we got I got 2 or 3 home pass that show. Show that as the uh, what do you call it? The contractual property or whatever it is? Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:44 PM
 Yeah.  Yep.  The.  Security. Yeah. Yeah. Which

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:44 PM
 The security. Yeah. Okay. And you look at it on Google Maps and it's a big cornfield or whatever I'm going. Yeah. And with that and north of Illinois, no wonder. It's cornfield, you know, exactly.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:44 PM
 you know, the land the  yeah.  Yeah. Yeah, they're scoring out there. So no I I really like that but the the the biggest thing is the liquidity that it gets you because they're willing to offer monthly payments. Then you can you can have your you can have your cake and eat it too. You can have your money.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:44 PM
 Yeah. Yeah.  I knew you were going to say that. Well, I like to keep it that way. I mean, I just was wondering, you know, I haven't we haven't really talked about it a lot in a while and, you know, and

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:44 PM
Yeah. Yeah.  well and I do I do go out and I try to find people who have different uh different options and different um services and like I want them to play my game but I tell them like hey if you're if you're not willing to guarantee,

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:45 PM
 Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:45 PM
 These 3 things, right? If you don't have this, you don't have that. It's gonna be a lot harder for me to recommend clients to you. Because I, I want my clients to have security consistency. I want them to know that it's back up with a piece of property, and you'd be surprised a lot of real estate. People don't want to give up that property. Uh, they don't want to put their money where their mouth is so to speak.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:45 PM
 Yeah, I see.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:45 PM
 So the the unique thing with home path,

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:45 PM
 Well, I'm glad you're on top of it.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:45 PM
 Yeah, the unique thing with home bath is there are they are a home builder, they're a developer. So they their business, they have a whole inventory of land and properties and all kinds of stuff that they really do. Have the flexibility where they're big enough. They could just pick pick a piece of property out of their portfolio and say, all right Jim this is the 1 you get if we don't pay

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:45 PM
 Oh yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:45 PM
 Okay, yeah, I see in case of a default or something you mean, right? Or

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:46 PM
 Right.  Yes.  Yeah, and that's what we want. We want. We want your name on.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:46 PM
 Thank God. Yeah, we would we haven't had that.  I go ahead.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:46 PM
 No, no. And I don't, I don't, I don't see that as highly likely, I think. Um, you know, obviously Anything could happen. But we're in a, we're in a situation with um,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:46 PM
With home path, you know, they've got the lowest, you know, last time I pulled their credit report, they've got the lowest risk rating that you can get or, you know, conversely, they are the highest rated, but the lowest risk, if that makes sense.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:46 PM
 Yeah, and these are the things that I wished I knew or had learned earlier, but, you know, it very well and that way we can talk about it or whatever. But this is the kind of this is the stuff about it, that doesn't make it boring to me, even though the maybe the, the transactional side of it is quite boring, but that's the part I do, like, as well, because it's not boring, it's predictable and not find that. You know, that's what I want. I want that reliability and predictability. Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:46 PM
 So,  Yeah. Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:47 PM
 Exactly.  well, and that's  And that's appropriate right now for your stage of life and, you know, you know, you know me, I'm I'm like, I'm very much like, yeah. Anybody can say anything, but you got to prove it right? Like, that's my mindset and um, I, um,

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:47 PM
so,  Yeah. Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:47 PM
 I think anybody should be looking for consistency and Security even if they're 20 years old, but especially at your stage of life, we're not sending you back to noordam gym. They can't, we can't call them back and say, oh Jim come back for another 10 years. I mean I don't know, they probably would take you. They're they're probably hurting without but we're not going to do that. And so,

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:47 PM
 Yeah, I mean, it's not it's just not practical to do that or whatever. It's because times are changing. Everything changes every day, even though you may not see it necessarily, but somebody does it somewhere and you may or may not know about it, you know, it's just

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:47 PM
Yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:47 PM
 You know, everything changes.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:47 PM
 Yeah.  So we have to be really. We have to be really careful because we know you're not going back to work and that like, that's a hard line. Jim's, not going back. And once Beth walked out the door, right? She's she was done on September 1st, is that right?

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:47 PM
 Everything Changes.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:48 PM
 Uh, September 5th. And then her everything starts today for us on our  On our Medicare. Uh, what do you call it the advantage plan? We've already I've already paid for, uh, I'm already paying for Medicare. Uh, let's see for her and me and I'm on it and I had a little problem and we'll talk about that later on. On the scheduled, not the schedule, what do you call it? The Plan D. The prescription 1 for me, I wasn't apparently covered over 63 days since like February last year. So I'm going to get that penalty per month. Added on to my. Yeah, I mean right now it's only going to be like 4 dollars more but it'll be like 7 dollars next year and that's based on if the government doesn't shut down or they get this health care if you worked out. I mean I have had this on for 24 hours now or whatever. I've been watching it since like Monday, Monday evening. And then I watched it all yesterday and then I watched it all today and different networks. So I can't really say

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:48 PM
 Okay, yep. Yep.  Okay.  Part part D. Yeah.  Oh boy.  Oh, no way.  Oh my gosh.  Alright. Alright.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:49 PM
Yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:49 PM
 Estimate, what my costs are going to be. I mean, I had numbers before to shut down. So, if all of that goes up, I mean, triples or quadruples or whatever. Then yeah, I'm going to be paying a whole hell of a lot more money or whatever. But anyway, that's that, but yeah, we're starting today officially on all of that.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:49 PM
 Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:49 PM
 you know, I know, a lot of the  Okay. Yeah, I know. I'm I'm

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:49 PM
 we started, I think last month for Medicare,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:49 PM
 Yeah, I'm paying attention to all of that too. I mean, it's definitely going to affect a lot of people and um, you know, I'm all for being financially prudent. Um, but at the same time there's a there's a way that our society works and you can't just come in with a baseball bat and start destroying, you know, everything just because you don't understand it. So it makes it very difficult to plan for what we're going to do.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:50 PM
 yeah, and And there's things I like about Trump. Yeah, there's things I like about Trump but a lot of times, you know, he doesn't know when to shut his mouth, you know what I mean?  he just, uh,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:50 PM
 Yeah yeah. That's but that's how it gets the views.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:50 PM
 I mean, I I Am pro Trump but he just you know, just some things he's doing, I don't know. I mean I have I get a big question mark in my brain. You know, like why did you do that? You know, he's just uh, I don't know.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:50 PM
 He he's he's a businessman, almost turned politician but not yet. You know. It it I mean you definitely better than Biden. But oh my God.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:50 PM
 Yeah.  I will, I will say this.  I will say this George W was able to get the Republican agenda passed.  And he didn't, he, he ruffled feathers, but he didn't have to upset the apple cart in order to do it.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:50 PM
 Uhuh.  Then that was the sun. You mean, right? Joe, you know, George W that he was the son. Yeah. Not the first boy. Yeah. Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:51 PM
 Yeah, George W. Yeah, now he was  that was and he was, you know, he was, he was in charge during 911 and the Iraq War and all that stuff, but he was able to

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:51 PM
 Yeah, that's right. Okay yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:51 PM
 He was able to get an agenda passed and he was able to do the thing, but he didn't have to. He didn't have to take a baseball bat and openly defy ports and all that. So he did it, but he did it. He did it in the background and he did it with some decorum and he did it with, oh, oh, there was a way of doing things. And whether, whether people agree with whatever, whatever the swamp means, I'm still trying to figure that out. Like I don't know who's in the swamp, I think they all are but, but what do you agree with it?

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:51 PM
 Yeah.  Yeah, no. I almost want to say, I want all of you gone and everybody, you know, however that work, you know, everybody needs to go who who's over 55 or 60 and start all over again with the younger people or whatever and let them figure out how to, you know, do all of this but that's easier said than done. But

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:51 PM
 Right.  Clear them out, clear them out and restart.  Yep.  I mean, maybe not 2, maybe not too young. Like we don't need to go 30s, but maybe like like 40s and 50s. Give them some life experience.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:51 PM
 yeah I mean and there should be a law but you can only serve what 3 terms or 4 terms I guess and kind of that but also the age would have to factor into that. Oh that's a whole another set of laws and everything somebody that's a draft up and right and what a mess but uh yeah. It's

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:51 PM
 Um, well, we'll watch it.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:52 PM
Yeah.  Well, we'll watch it. I mean, really for those kinds of things, I don't, I wouldn't watch it. I wouldn't watch it every day, right? You don't need to do that. You got to enjoy your time with Beth, right? Don't watch it every day. What you do?

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:52 PM
 Um, yeah. I mean

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:52 PM
 Because, you know, we've been through this. So I had a, um, back when I had a job and I worked for people and, you know, I wasn't running my own deal. I had a, I had a manager and, um, she, uh, there was a big Bill or a big decision coming down from the government that they were. Um, they were going to change Department of Labor rules somehow and we, you know, the company I worked for had like 500 employees, right? And so it was a pretty big company, uh, but we were going to have to change every single we had, we were going to have to analyze and update and change potentially every single person's job classification based on this new rule. And uh, I was all worked up about, oh we got to get on this. This is going to be a major project. We're going to have its going to take us hours to figure, right? And I wanted to be all gung-ho and jump the gun. And she's like no let's not, you know, let's not do anything yet. And I'm like, come on. We got to figure this out. She's like no, not yet and so we she finally had me do some spreadsheets and stuff, right?

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:52 PM
 Uh, huh.  Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:53 PM
Get start getting prepared. But we were within, like, 2 weeks of the deadline, I'm like, Abby, aren't we gonna aren't you worried about this? She's like, just, what? Just wait 3 days before the deadline? I'm freaking out and I'm like, we have to tell the employees that they're job. Classification is going to change. We need to give them notice. And she's like,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:53 PM
 Just wait 2 days before the deadline for this massive Federal change. Write 2 days you know some lawsuit goes through, there's an injunction and all of a sudden none of it matters, not a single piece of its going through. It literally didn't matter at all. So I

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:53 PM
 Yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:54 PM
Wow, it got halted right before the deadline. Whoa.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:54 PM
 Yeah, yeah. And she said I'm the she said, she said I've been through more of these supposed updates and changes and laws and rules than you can even count. She was, you know, that was 15 years ago, she was in her 70s at that point and I was like, okay, so I don't need to stress. Yeah, so the lesson I learned there was

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:54 PM
 Talk about Sweating Bullets, man. Wow.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:54 PM
 Wow, but he was a pro at it, no wonder Andy. Yeah.  Yeah, I've been through this, yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:54 PM
 we can watch that stuff. We know it's happening but we we just let it happen, until they finally land on whatever it is, they think they're going to do.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:54 PM
 Wow.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:54 PM
 and then once we have data that actually matters, you know, this um this tax bill that they passed in April or whatever that BBB bill,  they uh, there's a lot of upper

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:54 PM
 Oh the 1 on July 4th. Yeah past July 4th

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:54 PM
 Oh, July 4th. Okay, I thought it was April. Um, you know, I I've gone through it. I didn't read it until they passed it and once they passed it and it was signed, then I opened it up and I started looking through for all the opportunities.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:55 PM
 Yeah, you've gotten a lot further with it than me. It's too too sick and too big. I got other things. I'm looking at and analyzing and whatever and I mean I tried to look at it but I couldn't find it or whatever and I, I

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:55 PM
 Yeah, no.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:55 PM
 Can't remember, we're out of luck. But anyway, I was look, oh, it was uh tax-backed who I used to do my tax software, their software, they had some, you know, some bullets on, you know, different things about it, but it, it was not all that complete, you know? But just some things that here's what some of the things that will affect you. You know, etc, etc. That kind of thing. But uh, yeah, you know, I've just gotta mainly open that it would get stopped, you know, that bill,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:55 PM
 Yeah.  Oh yeah.  Right, right. Right.  Yep. Yeah so I I wouldn't I wouldn't watch, I wouldn't watch too much on it.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:55 PM
 Yeah. Well, I mean I've been watching mainly because I'm I'm more in Hope. But like I said, I've got it on and I've got it on mute and, you know, yeah, I mean, now president or vice president at Vance is talking, you know, and then they'll go back to Schumer. And then they'll go to hook him, Jeffrey. And then they'll be somebody else. And, you know, that back and forth, there's somebody's lying, you know, somewhere as usual.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:56 PM
 Yeah. So  Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah. Hey.  Uh, you know what? I tell my

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:56 PM
 You know, so hopefully they will work it out.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:56 PM
 You know what? I tell my kids.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:56 PM
 yeah, hopefully they can work it out, but

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:56 PM
 I'm trying to tell the I'm trying to teach the kids. I'm trying to teach the kids how to be good digital consumers. They don't have phones or anything yet. We're not we're not even kind of starting to get there but

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:56 PM
 I tell them I say, guys, here's how it works.  They want your attention, and why do they want your attention and all the kids go so they can get your money.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:56 PM
 There you go. Well that's the best best way to start so they can get your money.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:56 PM
if, if they and so the kids know,

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:56 PM
 Now, you get a gold star.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:56 PM
 Yeah. The kids know like anytime an ad comes up on the TV. I say guys. They got your attention. What are they gonna get next? And they all yell your money.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:56 PM
 Oh, I know it advertising gone way out the window, man. It is everywhere. I mean, on the TV, on the phones on a computer everywhere, billboard still newspapers, there's so much media and so much advertisement. So,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:57 PM

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:57 PM
 Okay.  Right.  Uhuh. Oh yeah. You guys are you guys are getting good at working this system. I love it. This is why you have to retire because after

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:57 PM
 I used to do that all the time whenever I took vacation, I take 1 less day and stack it around a couple of holidays and be off 3 weeks. And only have to take uh 12 days vacation or 13 days you know for 3 weeks instead of 15, I'd say 2. So they came today that's 16 hours man. That's 2 days or 3 or whatever it ended up being

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:57 PM
 This is why you have to. yeah, this is why you have to retire because after  After so many after so many years, you get to know the system. Well enough, that they're like, we can't have these people around. They're going to cost us too much money.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:58 PM
 Is that right?  But yeah, I mean, you know, they, they gave her some nice gift cards. And a matter of fact, the Olive Garden and we used them of that night of the 5th and and also Molly, uh, Molly graduated from South. What is it called? S Southern

 And Chris Rector car on the other day. So they had to borrow laws, but laws still can't see, so she's not able to drive. And we're still waiting on Laura to get her sight back.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:58 PM
 Oh boy. How, how is?  How is was it, Beth's?  Was it Beth's sister that fell the other a couple weeks ago.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:59 PM
 Yeah, if she's falling many times. Yeah, I mean, she got all scraped up and everything and that's all healed. But since she had that eye surgery, back in February, and then again, in April, she still can't see out of that eye. It's just know, they're just a little bit of color and little bit of light, but you get a detached retina and sometimes, you know, it can't be repaired.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:59 PM
 Oh no.  Yeah, did she get? Oh boy.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:59 PM
 you know, so

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:59 PM
 Alright. Alright. Oh

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:59 PM
 But she, she gets around, you know, or whatever. But, you know, she comes over and stays with us on the weekends and, and such and whatever. And like, I say we had a little party. I think it was Saturday. Yeah. Because, you know, Molly graduating and she got her little diploma and all that but

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:59 PM
 yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:59 PM
 Oh good.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:59 PM
 She she graduated, what does she got?  A so I don't even know. I never went to college, so  something come Lada or whatever. Um,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 04:59 PM
oh yeah, so she got she got excellent grades, then

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 04:59 PM
 Got.  Yeah, she got master or it's not a bachelor's degree, but it's something else. Something like that or better, anyway, she's going to be, uh, she can create websites and she, you know, she knows how to write software and she's a software engineer what she told me to keep it. Simple. I said, yeah, I appreciate it. Now, this little Lego set you gave me. It's got these micro pieces, you can finish putting it together. For me, I go, I need tweezers and a, and a headlamp to be able to see that. Now, when I was 35, I could put that together with my regular eyes and have glasses, but I had to start wearing glasses later. But anyway. Yeah, everybody other than that doing. All right. And I don't know. We might have to try to get her a car. Thank God, I got some money in my big Loft yet. Right now I'm getting ready to probably hammer down on that and it's so nice having that there. Dude, it really is. It's nice having that several thousand dollars to just go and get and I need to and I may have to get the house picked up here pretty soon. And I got some

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:00 PM
 Yeah.  All right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:00 PM
 Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah.  well, what you  Yeah.  well, make sure make sure that you uh,

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:00 PM
Wood. Rot.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:00 PM
 Make sure you run the carfax report and get an inspection before you buy before you buy anything. I actually had another client today, who bought a had to buy a car for her son. It was $6,000. And they they kind of did it in a rush and, um, turns out the car had

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:01 PM
 Oh yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:01 PM
 No, I don't do that.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:01 PM
 Yeah, car had some bad headlights and the brakes were all bad and it was going to be thousand dollars to fix it. And uh so just just do your due diligence with those parts. I think I think there's so many people who feel squeezed right now financially that they're resorting to not really good stuff but you know as far as Selling Stuff they're they're not really being upfront with things because they're trying to get things off their lot and you know move things out before the economy gets any worse.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:01 PM
 Oh yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:01 PM
 Yeah, because I want to convert what they can to cash and try to get back to cash or whatever because it's electronically, you know, or whatever. We're I guess we're still in in an inflation levels or whatever. I mean gas is a lot cheaper down here. I don't know about Kansas City but um,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:01 PM
 Yeah.  Yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:01 PM
 It's it's gotten a lot cheaper. It's like 2 2, 40 of gallon for the E10 and 100% fuel 3 or no 2 uh about 285 to 290 95, I guess 295 for for the real fuel, you know, 100% fuel, which I don't have to run that but she does in her Equinox. But I got a I got a flex fuel in my Impala so I can run either fuel or either side whatever and it's not so hard on the Rubber and shield and stuff but that ET

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:02 PM
 Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:02 PM
 Oh good.  Yeah.  Well, I went to the store.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:02 PM
 Can lead up, eat up rubber on, on the cars. It's not designed for it.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:02 PM
 I went and got the  went and got the kids.  Holy cow. It was, it was uh,

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:02 PM
 You got them, what you're breaking up.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:02 PM
 It was 5.19 cents for a gallon of milk.  Sorry, hold on a second. I went and got the kids.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:02 PM
 5. Well.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:02 PM
yeah, I was like, holy

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:02 PM
 we could, we could that, uh,  What is that called? Fair life.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:02 PM
 Holy cow is there.  Is there go? No, this was like, this was like the store brand all the rest of them were even higher than that. And I just went to the local grocery store. I wasn't at a Whole Foods or anything.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:03 PM
 Right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:03 PM
 so,

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:03 PM
 Well, we, uh  I don't think it's a gallon, though. It's like a, I don't know what it is. It's, it's a 3/4 of a gallon, but it's called Fair life. And it's like Ultra filtered or whatever and it's lactose free. And I mean, I'd, I'd rather drink a regular good old whole milk. If that's the kind you get, I don't know what kind they specifically drink? But there's so many different kinds of milk, nowadays and whatever. But I always like whole milk and I like chocolate milk, but I like migration of chocolate milk, which is white, milk and Hershey's syrup poured into it, you know,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:03 PM
 Yeah.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  Oh, that's the that's the original kind.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:03 PM
 No, I know that's the original kind, that's as good as old boarding. That's chocolate, man. But anyway, yeah,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:03 PM
 Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:03 PM
 more stuff that I like.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:03 PM
 Well, okay, so what questions do we have? So that's getting her. You guys got the paperwork already done for the pension stuff, right? That that's already been done for a while.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:03 PM
 Yeah, when we turn that in, I think I mailed that right after you had looked at that we mailed it the next day I think and they got it and we followed up and everything and then we called not this not Monday. Let's see, today's Wednesday we called last week on Thursday I think. And she said, yeah, and you're, you got to check coming and then she gave me the amount and apparently they took the 401K and then the, what I was calling stock AEP stock or whatever, but it was a budget pension plan, but they've got it all put together in 1, uh, deal. And they are emailing. The, they have mailed the check, and she gave us the amount. And it's actually a little bit more than they projected. Like, I don't know, 2506060, more than what they projected Back 2 months ago. Yeah. Well, that's still leaking is up.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:04 PM
 Okay.  Oh, okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:04 PM
Anytime.  Okay.  We have.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:04 PM
 What?  You're not gonna send it back, are you?

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:04 PM
No, no. I ain't gonna send it back, but I'm just saying, you know, in in tracking down the amount, you know, but no it it hasn't got here yet. I expect it tomorrow or Friday, it should be here because her insurance ran out yesterday, and she is officially retired. Well, I mean, her insurance ran out at work. She's on Medicare, we've got her on Medicare, she's on a and b, he signed up right away, and I got on B, without any problem, I got the little form filled out by a, they did it, their her work. So, I got all that done. I got something in the mail, the other day from optimar X about that. That, uh, uh, Medicare D prescription plan. It shows that you've, you've been over 63 days without a Medicare approved, drug plan and, and I don't use the drug plan and I hadn't used 1 even on hers, but I should have at least signed up for it but I didn't know you supposed to do that and then they say later on in the letter, well ignorance is 9/10 of the law, so you're still alive.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:05 PM
 Yeah.  Okay.  Right.  Oh boy.  Oh, okay. Well, okay. Okay, good. Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:05 PM
Right.  Yeah.  Okay, right.  so,

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:05 PM
 For paying the penalty. At least. That's what I think they'll say, I sent it back to them and said, look, I was covered and I put down her Ascension or whatever it was her work Insurance, you know, card data and everything and information group number and all of that mess and so I'm waiting to hear back from them. It went to Florida Tampa, Florida.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:06 PM
Cheese.  Yeah.  Yeah, don't don't let them uh don't don't let that go without a fight. A lot of times if you just push back on them, they'll fix it up.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:06 PM
 Yeah, I know it isn't much, but I'm I'm going to try that or whatever. But anyway, even if I do have to pay it, I've also found out that hey, you can write off, Medicare, you can write off the Medicare Advantage fee. Everything is tax deductible because that premiums, that's medical cards that you pay. And I've already found that out. No, there you go. So I have to use that in that way. Then I will.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:06 PM
 so,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:06 PM
 Yeah, there you go.  Awesome. Awesome.  Yeah, no, that's a good.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:06 PM
 I will indeed add more to the Scottish made but anyway so that's that's item 1.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:06 PM
 Take.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:06 PM
 That was cool.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:06 PM
 Yeah.  Can you hear me?

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:06 PM
 Yeah, that was cool. Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:06 PM
 Okay.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:06 PM
 Yeah, you had some cool music on there or whatever like the sounds of Southern Kansas City.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:07 PM
 oh yeah, I hit I hit a  I I think I hit a button on my phone and then it just blanked out for a second and I I don't know what happened there.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:07 PM
 oh,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:07 PM
 Sorry.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:07 PM
 Well, all it did. Is it put music on like I was on hold. It must be a, you have a whole feature, I do.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:07 PM
 Oh it's weird. I was yeah you just it just cut out. It just cut out for a second that was my uh this is my my work phone and it has a whole bunch of extra features. I don't know.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:07 PM
 oh,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:07 PM
 I don't know that I really need them, but

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:07 PM
 anyway, um,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:07 PM
 Um okay so you guys got the check coming now that checks made out to directed IRA and we're going to just forward it on to directed Ira right?

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:07 PM
 Yeah, that should be the case because I specified all of that in the pension packet. Paperwork thing we sent that in, we got all that taken care of first. The next I got will get the rollover check in the mail and then I'm going to overnight. It said exit the dir trust in Phoenix and I figured out which which um address I'm going to use its the 1 for incoming check and I was able, excuse me a second indigestion too much chicken at lunch, I guess. But um,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:07 PM
 Yep.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:08 PM
Yeah. There there was like 4 different options, you know, on on the, you know, the way they receive, you know, funds and stuff like that. So I'm going to send it to the it's the same 1 that we sent the check to back, you know, several months ago and we did that little partial send over, you know,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:08 PM
 Should be, yeah.  Should be pretty similar. Um, and they do you have the, um, do you have the deposit instruction forms? That lets them know,

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:08 PM
 so,  Yeah, so do that.  Okay, that's the second. That's the second item. I was just going to get to that and then I'm going, Andy, here's the question mark. Could you get the deposit form from Dr? Trust site. Because I cannot find it

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:08 PM
 Uh, yes.  yes, I've got it and I can

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:08 PM
 And then, okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:08 PM
I can make sure you get a copy of that so you can send it in the letter when you send the chat.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:08 PM
 Okay, I send it in the okay, so I make a paper copy of it then and we don't do it electronically.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:08 PM
 Well, you can, you can do it electronically. Um, let me see if I can figure out where it's at, on the site, um, because I know they really like to in they're, they're really pushing to encourage us to use that.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:09 PM
 That new portal do everything.  Let me see if I can.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:09 PM
 Well, I tell you what, I look for my 20 minutes the other night and I just cannot find it. I just can't find it. I I don't know. I mean I don't get a warm easily understand. You know the fun. The what do you call it? The subjects of their buttons you know or what what the buttons say. Anyway, I couldn't find it.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:09 PM
 Hold on a second. Let me get logged in then they're probably.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:09 PM
 Create create new Investments and live in now.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:09 PM
 They're probably going to have me 2 Factor authenticate.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:09 PM
 Oh, you're, you're just trying to get on the side or you are. You allowed into bedside in my side as well? I mean are you able to do that?

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:09 PM
 I'm just,  uh,  no, I can't log into yours but I have a, um,

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:09 PM
 I don't know if you can do something.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:10 PM
 I have.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:10 PM
 So you have your own, I guess. Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:10 PM
 I have 1 that that is kind of connected with your guys's account. So,  Um, there we go. Okay. So Document Center.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:10 PM
 I don't know how all that works.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:10 PM
 Um, give me a second. I'm looking it up here.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:10 PM
 But you'll find it probably within a minute.  Because you'll I don't know you you've been into it before because you got it for us back in the spring. When we had that little partial, check that, whatever it was 14,000 and we sent over to

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:10 PM
 Yes.  so,

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:10 PM
 The 1 that got lost in the mail, Remember by UTSA or bassoon.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:10 PM
 yeah, so I think I  Oh gosh. That 1 G's Louise.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:10 PM
 so,  You found it already, golly. I feel like tomorrow.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:10 PM
 I did I do I do. I think I have it.  Do you think that I have it? Um, so are you, are you?

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:10 PM
 Okay.  Statements, I can email that to you if you can, if you can send it from your end, but if you can't, then if you can send it to me and then I'll take everything to FedEx and make a copy of it and fill it out in by hand, or whatever. If you think that's a better way to do it, not going to include that. And and the, uh, the statement and have it all sent to them by, you know, snail mail or whatever.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:11 PM
 Yeah.  Honestly.  Yeah, honestly, I think if you just kind of had it printed out and put everything together in the letter so that it was all in 1 spot, they get the check, they get the statement and they get the deposit instructions. I think that's probably the best way to make sure that there's not any hiccups.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:11 PM
Yeah.  That's what I thought because they, or they don't issue or they don't do a direct rollover from her, whatever, retirement company, empowers. What it's called or whatever. They just issue a check. It's up to her, and her responsibility to do the roll over to whatever you want to do. If you're taking it outside of the companies, you know system, you know what I mean. In other words, it seems that she had just left it alone. They would have taken care of it and put it into an IRA that they that's their, they're the custodian whoever they use, you know, 12 or whoever the hell. It was, I don't remember but that's not what we were going to do. She's already got an IRA, a self-directed and that's the 1 we wanted in and we want to completely away from them and they were a little bit you know adamant about are you sure you want to do this? You know, and everything and I could

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:11 PM
 Yeah, and I think it's a yeah, I think it's a security.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:12 PM
Right. Yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:12 PM
 You know, I've been been through it enough times, but hopefully this will be the last 1, you know, to deal to deal with that.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:12 PM
 Yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:12 PM
 so,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:12 PM
 Okay, so here I'm forwarding.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:12 PM
 You need to, you need to send me the the, the pro deposit slip then right, and then I'll get it and then I can put it on a thumb drive and take everything to FedEx put the 2 documents which is like what I did. Whenever I got that other copy that I sent to you and it still didn't copy all of it when she when she tried to bounce it over from the machine onto the thumb drive. And I paid like $35 for that for those documents that you were looking at of those of the earth engine and all that and uh,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:12 PM
 Yep.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:13 PM
 Oh yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:13 PM
 So anyway, uh, I'm going to take it. I'm going to print them out and then I'm going to fill them in. Then I'm going to make copies of that. And then I'm going to put everything into the envelope and FedEx. The whole thing overnight. It's $68 or whatever it is 2, right 2 directed trucks in Phoenix.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:13 PM
 I think, yeah.  I think you should.  Make sure that every yeah I think I agree with that. Like let's make sure everything is all in 1 spot. Just  Just to make it easier for them and minimize any chance that you got 1 form and 1 spot and then the checks in another spot and with email the statement we should just put it all together to keep it keep it nice and clean for them.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:13 PM
 Right.  And I, uh, I've got the  The pension uh, statement or whatever. It's the  I don't know, it's the latest 1 is June June 30th because the the next 1 just ended yesterday and it won't generate until later on and hopefully I'll have it all in there and you've already created a new home path. And that's the third, the third item, you know, then once the money is in best account, we need another investment paying, at least the 8% or better on a. I want to do an 80k. The amount of the check is 100 10K, almost 111. So I can let you know, you know, the specifics of it.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:14 PM
Mhm.  Okay.  Okay.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:14 PM
 Over time here and within the next month.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:14 PM
 Yeah. And for that, I mean for that that's the same that's the same process. We've done several times over, you know, we do the secured Capital agreement, send it in, they accept it and then they give us a closing date. And that, that should be pretty easy.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:14 PM
Yeah. Yeah.  Okay.  and uh,  Let's see. So, yeah, if if we're going to go ahead and use a new home pass create another new home path and, uh,  That's the investment vehicle. We're going to use because of its predictability and low risk and that's exactly what I like.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:14 PM
 now, I  Here's, here's my game plan. How old is Beth now?

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:14 PM
 65.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:14 PM
 65. Yeah. And how old are you?

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:14 PM
 2 months.  I'll be 67 next week.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:15 PM
 67. All right, I think right around what I'm targeting is right around 70. For both of you guys that as we have some of these. Um, as we have some of these home paths, start to come to term that we start looking at the different options. Um, as far as the income annuities like the ones you've already got

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:15 PM
As you get as you get closer to 70 and over 70, we can actually start to get higher than 8% on the same amount of money. So I had a lady that got 12% on 1 of them.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:15 PM
 Yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:15 PM
 You're talking about 2 in an annuity.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:15 PM
 Right. So when I look at the numbers, if I right, so here's the strategy. As long as home path is kind of the better option. Then we'll do that because it gets you more money in your pocket. But at some point you guys are going to

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:15 PM
 oh, really

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:15 PM
 Well, yeah. And and right away, here's my strategy. I want to do it right, a more right away while I am or not quite 70, you know, right. I want to do it before we turn 70, another way I still want to still want to do some stuff with the money and not just tie it up in an annuity because that all my stuff is in an annuity, it will accept that laugh home bad. That I got that's that you got me or no you you renewed it this year. Remember earlier, back in February you renewed it

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:16 PM
 write.  Uh, huh.  Yes.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:16 PM
 Yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:16 PM
 And so it went another 5 years, it's just it wasn't on 8 and a half percent. It was on 8 so I'm getting 267 or whatever it is a month and then I'm taking quarterly, distributions on that at 700 and whatever it is. But anyway, that's my last Home pad. Everything else I've got is all an annuities what I want with Bev and what she wants, we talked about, we want to keep her making money on her and not quite getting an annuity just yet and if hindsight's 2020 on May of wanted to do that. But I you know I mean I'm not tripping about it, I kind of wished I had and 1 on 1 day and then ah it's okay. I should have kept 1 of them out and got another home path or something to make a little bit more money on it, I guess, but

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:17 PM
 Right.  Yes.  Right.  Yes. And so  yeah.  no, I don't think it makes  right.  Well, keep in mind.  Well, don't don't forget, don't forget the annuities that you do have. Um,  Basically, the fact that you've held off for this long, makes it that much better, but there was never a requirement for you to even hold off this long. So when we do them, you know, I think it's, you know, I'm just giving you the preview for once you guys are 5 years out, when you guys are 70 or whatever, there are lots of annuities where we can just turn the income on right away and we don't you don't have to wait.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:17 PM
And they're in the higher percentage.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:17 PM
 Right, because you'll be older.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:17 PM
Like mentioned, okay, cool.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:17 PM
 Yes, so and that's that's the kind of thing. We'll just have to look.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:17 PM
 Yeah. I'm I'm more interested in doing that at 72. Yeah, 71 or 72 and she'll be. She's only a year and 9 months younger than me. So, you know she'd be right after that roughly, you know, like the next year or so, you know.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:17 PM
 Yeah. Yeah.  I think that makes more sense.  Yeah.  yeah, so no, I think we're

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:17 PM
 She'll be 70 and 2030, and I'll be 70 and 2028, you know, late 2028.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:18 PM
 Yeah.  Yeah.  And I know you've been tracking, uh, I know you've been tracking those aine annuities, uh, that we did. We you the ones that you're waiting to turn on basically the longer you. Wait, the more money you get. And so that's a, that's a feature, not a bug. And so you can take those whenever you want because I kind of planned for you to take them right away when we set them up and then you didn't and you went and messed up my plan and you're gonna have more money than I calculated. So gosh, you just keep doing that.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:18 PM
 Huh.  Oh, shame on me, huh? I'm gonna have more money.  Yeah, I just kind of want to what I can up front and then, you know, they'll still be enough for a legacy or whatever. But here's the thing on the aine, I've been in there looking around and yeah, I'm going to have to have you help me get that set up to create whatever but I don't want to do it until March which is still what uh, 5 months from now. But if I wait till March, I will have held that for 2 years. Exactly.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:18 PM
Right.  Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah.  Okay. Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  That'll be another another year full year in. Yep, I agree.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:19 PM
 Yeah, because it started in February 2023. Yeah, February 2023. I wasn't even retired yet. Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:19 PM
 Okay.  No, uh, uh, well that's I think there there's a little bit of uh, I think we did make the right move there because you had the flexibility to wait, and you didn't have to turn them on right away, which meant they had. They had extra time to grow.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:19 PM
 Right. Yeah, I mean that's something about

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:19 PM
 So that's not a bad thing. It's not it's not a terrible thing. And when that, when that income turns on, you know, in general, the kind of the the the the um oh, what's the word? I'm looking for the

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:19 PM
 That. Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:19 PM
 The saying the saying in the financial planning World goes the older, you get the slower you go. Right? And so you know, you guys, you guys are pretty active right now, you're young. You're going to do a bunch of stuff, you're going to Scotland every other year, whatever, right? But when you're in your when you're in your 80s you're probably not going to be doing it quite to that level and so

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:20 PM
 Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:20 PM
 Getting an annuity when you're 78. That brings in an additional $200 a month, that feels like a lot of extra income at 78 for 200 bucks a month, even though it doesn't sound like it. Now, when you're, you know, maybe you're down to, maybe you're down to a piece of toast and an egg for breakfast. And then you go get a light lunch at 4:30. And that's all you need for the day. All of a sudden, your grocery bill is not as high, right? And I've had that happen, you know, I had a guy Bob, uh, his name was Bob. He he's passed since then, but he was 85 and I mean, this guy would go out and chop wood and I had to finally, get together with his daughter. And we had to beg him to stop chopping wood because he started hurting himself. We were like Bob, you need to sit down and stop.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:20 PM
 Yeah, I yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:20 PM
 But you know, he had just gotten to the point, you know? And we we did some home paths with him and he just rolled it and rolled it and rolled it and he was you know he's a you know thousands of dollars a month that he just didn't have anything to spend on.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:20 PM
 so,

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:20 PM
Wow.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:20 PM
 So the goal is to get you the income piece solved and you know it where we're where you're at now. It's not a uh it's not a fast process that we're going to do. We're not trying to do this, you know, this year next year. But over a 5 or 10 year period, we solved that income problem and we just keep stacking the income over time. You may very well end up with some home paths um that you still have when when you're in your 70s and 80s. I I don't think it's a terrible thing at all we just want want to make sure that we kind of spread out that income across you know, some different companies and different

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:21 PM
 Opportunities on, and they're going to offer.  12% of 8. And when that happens, we'll be ready to go. Okay, Home Path. Thanks so much for the last 15 years. We're going to get our 12% now.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:21 PM
 Yeah, well I've got a spreadsheet on on Bev's IRA and hers is a lot further out than mine all the way to like 2032. That's the year she turned 72, but this was like January figuring that you know, everything will be in by then uh we're taking regular withdrawals, of course, the withdrawals that I've got anticipated. Everything's a projection. Of course you got to understand that. I mean, I know you know that but it's going to be a lot more. It's going to be around.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:22 PM
uhh,  okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:22 PM
 I love it. I love it.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:22 PM
 On the $1,000 level in the year 2031 before she hits that 72. I don't even plan on having to raise to where I got to hit that required minimum distribution but but that affects the by the time I mean by 72 but that also affects annuities too, doesn't it?

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:22 PM
 Yeah.  Right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:22 PM
 Yes, it does. And

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:22 PM
 Does that work?

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:22 PM
 well, the annuity companies, they they will, they basically whatever, whatever their projects are and whatever it is, you do they absolutely guarantee that they're that there is enough withdrawal for

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:22 PM
 Um, the required rmd because they have to. So they always know that 72 Mark and there's always going to be a a guaranteed amount for the rmd.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:23 PM
 Well, and then even if I'm taking, you know, I'm pulling money from an annuity, I'm still going to be taxed on it.  so,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:23 PM
 Yes, that's true.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:23 PM
 I mean that's cuz it's time to get that money and once it's income. Now you got to pay tax on it, you know.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:23 PM
 Yep, absolutely. Well

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:23 PM
 The government's going to get that damn money. You know, whatever 1 way or the other. But yeah, we've

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:23 PM
 Yeah, any it may be the kind of thing, you know, depending on how it shakes out, we're gonna I think we just kind of got to keep doing our reviews over the next 5 years. Once you both once you both even next year, we can look at it as soon as next year. Once you both are done having active income. You your tax rates going to drop drastically.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:23 PM
 Having active income. Now, what you what does that mean? Exactly. You talk about,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:23 PM
 like,

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:23 PM
 just from like a job or occupation, or

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:23 PM
 yeah, once you're done with your W2 income,  you'll be in a lower.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:23 PM
Well dude, we're going to be done with it when I file next year. We're done with it because

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:23 PM
 Right? So 2026, we can

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:23 PM
 yeah, if he's got the only with W2, that's left.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:24 PM
 Yeah, 2026. We can look at the uh, we can look at the option to  Sorry, 2026. We can look at the option to do some Roth conversions, and it might be super, super cheap especially with the new tax law that go into effect. There's a really there's a really good opportunity for 26, that in the first year, after your retirement, we can get some of this moved over to a permanently tax-free status.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:24 PM
 Oh, you're talking about taking some of the traditional IRA money and converting it to a Roth IRA.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:24 PM
 Correct.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:24 PM
 That's what you're talking about.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:24 PM
 Yes, that Roth.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:24 PM
 And then you take that money, I guess and invested in a home path or invested in some strong vehicle that pays it at least 8% or 9, or whatever you can get.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:24 PM
 Khan.  Yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:24 PM
 Or, or even put it in a newity. But okay. Yeah, because I've got 1 1 annuity. That pays me that 100 and it's almost $200 a month. It's like, 198 or something, 197 and 98 cents, I think. And even though I have to claim it on taxes, I'm not taxed on it because it's an IR. It's a Ross version of the IRA, you know?

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:24 PM
 Exactly. Now,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:25 PM
M.  It's a Roth right now. We could we could look at converting we could look at converting the the traditional annuities that's a traditional IRA we can, you can do Roth conversions on annuities too.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:25 PM
 I was just getting ready to ask that. I didn't know you could you you take a traditional wire, you can take an additional annuity and convert it to a Roth IRA. You know, you're converting it to a Roth annuity. It's called a Rob annuity, I guess. Okay?

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:25 PM
 Annuity. Yep. Yep.  Yes. Yep.  That's true. So

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:25 PM
 Then you surprise me again, dude.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:25 PM
 We're, we're gonna have options. I guess is what I wanted to make sure you knew is we got

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:25 PM
 No doubt. Yeah, you said a couple years ago, you said just wait till you guys are both retired and and all the different cards you'll have in 1 hand, you know, the different options. Yeah. Okay, yeah, that's something cool, you know.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:25 PM
 yeah.  yep, it's  it's the Magic Window.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:25 PM
 Cuz right now all my project is, Andy are all based in 1 on the spreadsheet. Everything's out of the 1, Iraqis, sure are nice and way up there. Of course I don't know how much good that money will be in a later on a cashless Society or or whatever, you know. However, it's going to go here, but I think something major is going to go down here at sometime within the next 10 years. I just don't, I took the way I feel about everything.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:25 PM
 Yep. Yep.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:26 PM
Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's not.  Can't continue the way it's going. That's for sure.  I don't know, I'll tell you what. Jim, I'll tell you what. Jim, I went to Spain and they, you could go on the, you can go walk down the street and you can get lunch for

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:26 PM
 That's right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:26 PM
 it's so cheap.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:26 PM
 you can put,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:26 PM
 You can get lunch for 12.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:26 PM
 I didn't understand.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:26 PM
 You can get lunch for 12 dollars.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:26 PM
 Oh lunch. For 12 dollars, that's not much at all.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:26 PM
 For 2 people. Mary and I  Marry and I ate, we both ate for 12 to 15 dollars on the street like just at any restaurant it was crazy. It was so cheap.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:27 PM
 Wow.  That's sweet.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:27 PM
 Yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:27 PM
 That is cheap.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:27 PM
 And then I I came back and I had to get something, I was in Dallas. And I, I had been, you know, they gave us food on the plane but, you know, it was like, you know, it was just these little teeny tiny bits. It wasn't really a meal and uh, so I got back to Dallas and I was really hungry. I was like, all right, I'm going to have to get food. I went to a pizza and I got a personal pan pizza from the airport. It was 22 dollars.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:27 PM
 WOW.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:27 PM
 Oh, I wouldn't doubt that we ate at Arby's in the 1 and I had a hamburger Arby's roast beef. This was the 1, we went in 2023 to Scotland.  Um, yeah, it was 3131 in the Atlanta airport. I mean, it was, you know, pretty good, but it was ridiculous. I mean, we just got the normal thing we buy like here, you know, you get the, the drink and the curly fries and a sandwich and hers. But she got the little. She likes the little Bronco Berry and the cheese bike or something and a drink and it's $31 after tax whatever not in August because it's Georgia. Taxes are higher in Georgia. I don't know, but it was at the airport my God they got you, they know it. You know you can't go anywhere.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:27 PM
Oh God. Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:28 PM
 Yep. yeah, I  Could not believe it how?  Yeah. So  well, we gotta we  yeah, so we gotta keep you guys up with inflation but the goal what we're going to do is we're going to keep, we're just going to keep going back and forth between your policy and the Home Pass, and the policy and the Home Pass, and then as you get older, there is a point where I can run the calculations, I call up the annuity companies and I

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:28 PM
 Jim 73 right now or whatever. How much will you pay? And they go oh you know we'll pay 12% or whatever, right? And I'm like okay Jim you got you can

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:28 PM
Hello.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:28 PM
 Yeah. And so that those conversations will happen over the next, uh, you know, 5 years plus. Right that we don't have to worry about that today. I think I think we take the 8% now, get the cash dropped into an account that you can access. And then, you know, something happens, worst case scenario you can pull it from the IRA if you need it. Otherwise just cycle it back through your insurance over and over until you get 2, big pots of money.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:28 PM
 Breaking up again.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:29 PM
 Yeah, that's kind of what I'm doing now. But can you explain again, you broke up and I didn't hear you for 4 or 5 Seconds there, right? After you said the 12% after you call the annuity company or something and then I didn't hear what you said after that.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:29 PM
oh,  oh, and then I then I call you and I say, hey you can upgrade from 8 to 12 percent, you're ready to go and we'll just

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:29 PM
 So that's within the annuity. That's not a Ross conversion or

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:29 PM
 no, so what I'm

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:29 PM
 Because I'm getting them mixed up. I mean that's a different method or something, right? Doing a Ross conversion.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:29 PM
 Yeah, no, I'm not talking about the Roth. I'm just talking about whether or not you do a home path or an annuity. And I think with with your guys's age because the way the annuities work, right? They're going to pay you an income based on how long they think you're going to live. And what the annuity company is hoping for is they're hoping you don't live too long, right?

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:29 PM
 Right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:29 PM
 And so the older you are the higher, they have to pay you an income because you're not going to live as long.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:29 PM
Right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:30 PM
 So they're hoping you die soon. Whereas the life insurance company is hoping you take a really long time to be alive and pay premiums. So they're 2 side to the same coin.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:30 PM
 ah,  okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:30 PM
 and so, the

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:30 PM
 Yeah, I'm kind of thinking about strategy for that though, I mean because because when I die, I wanted to continue on for Bev but when she dies it'll continue and it'll go to the trust. Is that how it's set up to work?

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:30 PM
 Right. So the the  Well, so let's, let's take an easy example. Let's say you give a, let's say, you give a an annuity company, a hundred thousand dollars, right and they agree to pay you.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:30 PM
 At 873.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:30 PM
 um,  Sure, let's say 68, let's say age 60, let's say.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:30 PM
 68.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:30 PM
 Let's say 70. Let's just say 70. Keep it simple. You give them a hundred thousand dollars and they go Jim, you're 70. We think you've got a statistical chance of living x amount of dollars. We're going to pay you 10% for this hundred thousand dollars so they send you a check for dollars every year, right.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:30 PM
 Okay.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:31 PM
 Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:31 PM
You live for 6 more years. How much did they have to pay you?  60,000 right.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:31 PM
 60,000 yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:31 PM
 Now that means you gave them $0 more than what you got back.  In that case.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:31 PM
 Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:31 PM
 In that case, these, the payments of dollars could either continue to best until she died. Now, if now, you live, 6, more years, Beth lives 2 more years. Now, they've paid out 80,000 dollars, but you only gave them, you gave them a hundred. So you guys in your trust and your family is still short 20,000. And in that case,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:31 PM
 they would pay out the rest of the 20,000 dollars to the trust.  Right.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:31 PM
 They do pay it to the trust. That's what I really wanted to know.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:31 PM
 Yes.  Right? And that's, that's a return.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:31 PM
 And I know we've talked about this before, okay?

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:31 PM
 Now, if you live 10 years, let's say you well let's do this. Let's say you live 14 years and Beth lives in another 16 years. So 14 years goes by now, they've paid you $140,000. You owe me paid $100,000, you got 40 more thousand dollars out of them than you put in.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:32 PM
 I'm I'm plus 40 and then I die. And she lives another 2 years after me. They still pay another 20,000, right?

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:32 PM
And that keeps getting.  Now you guys are getting 60 Grand off of them when you only gave them a 100. But here's the thing, because the original 100 was used up when Beth dies, that's that they don't, they don't pay out anymore.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:32 PM
 Okay. Yeah, I mean that's not logical to do so. So that wouldn't go to the truck or, yeah, it's done. After the second death over any, any, uh, what do you call that, that the, the 100,000, what's that called? The initial amount I guess or whatever? Yeah. Okay, I understand it. Now a lot better. Okay, that makes sense. Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:32 PM
 Right.  Right.  Exactly.  Yeah, the principal. Yeah.  Yeah, yes.  So it protects you, it it protects you from making a big investment that you you're not you're not basically you're not going to be just paying money to the company and then you die 2 years later. And they take all the money from your family that we're not going to set it up that way that that used to happen with other annuities, that aren't the kinds that I do. Um, but I, I don't do it that way. Um,

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:33 PM
Yeah.  Right.  Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:33 PM
 Now here's the other scenario, it's really considered because this is where the benefit really plays out you guys get a hundred thousand dollars. Annuity at age 70 it pays ten thousand dollars a year you live to be 98.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:33 PM
That's 20 28 years, right? They pay they pay you $180,000 on your hundred thousand dollars, right? Because write 10 plus, 18 is 28, you live, another 28 years now and Beth lives, 2 years longer than you do. So she lives right to be 99 and write 2 more years, past year, or whatever. Um,

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:33 PM
 Wow.  Right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:33 PM
 so,  Now you guys more than made that money back and the annuity companies on the hook for managing their business and making sure they can pay that much money for that long, which they are very good at doing.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:34 PM
 But I guess some of them go bankrupt and you're out money.  I guess that's happened on the bank. I'm always looking at the worst case scenario in most things. If you've noticed

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:34 PM
um, that has yes, that has  Right? No, that has happened. But here's here's. What is important? Um, every state, uh, every state department of insurance mandates, a basically an Insurance Fund for insurance companies and so all the insurance companies in the state have to pay into this Insurance Fund. That is managed by the department of insurance at the state. So it's regulated. So if an annuity or insurance company goes under,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:34 PM
 the Insurance Fund takes over the policies from that company and typically

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:34 PM
 oh,  oh,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:34 PM
 It is the idea that it all that, that the policy get reabsorbed and sold off the other companies. So that the the client who got the original benefit, still had that benefit.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:35 PM
 I see it's a big protection for the, for the customer. It sounds like, yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:35 PM
 Right.  Yes, but it's managed, here's the trick. It's managed at the state level, which means you don't have Federal

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:35 PM
 Cool.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:35 PM
 Hands in the pie.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:35 PM
 Do you have federal taxes taken out of it when you take your withdrawals?

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:35 PM
Well, all the taxes are, you know, all of that. Just Remains the Same. If it was an annuity that was in a traditional IRA, All of That Remains the Same. But what I mean is, you don't have Federal politicians who think they can access that money and do things with it, like, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, right? The, the FDIC you remember, you see those signs at the bank? That say, um, that say, oh, your money guaranteed up to 250,000, FDIC Federal Deposit, Insurance Corporation, right?

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:35 PM
 Oh, I see ya.  All right.  Right.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:35 PM
 Yeah, I know exactly what that is. I've been hearing that for years and seeing that on the bank signs and FDI insured. And yeah, I'm well aware of that. Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:36 PM
 but,  That promise is only good if there's money to actually pay to those bank accounts.  And the FDIC announced in. I don't know, 2019 and this is after all the co stuff, right? They've had all kinds of issues. I don't think they're, they're at their reserved level, but they made a big announcement in 2019 that they had finally achieved their Reserve goal of having enough money in their reserves that they were considered, you know,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:36 PM
 Appropriate and following the laws, stable enough to guarantee, every bank account in the nation. Do you know what percentage? The reserved level was

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:36 PM
Oh, I bet it was low.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:36 PM
 1.8% of the obligations that it owes.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:36 PM
 What?

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:36 PM
 Does that sound like any kind of a reserved for you?

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:36 PM
 Not really.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:36 PM
 No way, right?

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:36 PM
 I'm expecting you to say 5% or 7% or whatever, you know, I mean we I knew it wasn't going to be a 100 100 or even 50%.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:37 PM
 No.  1 1.  yeah, 1.8  Now yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:37 PM
 Percent 1 Point. That's not even 2%.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:37 PM
Right now, the the state department of insurance, they require insurance companies to maintain. A lot of times, I don't know what it is. It's, I don't know exactly what it is in Oklahoma, but it's anywhere between 90 and 110%. So that means before the insurance company can claim that it has processed

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:37 PM
 Man.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:37 PM
 it has to set aside a dollar 10 for every dollar, it owes

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:37 PM
 Whoa.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:37 PM
 So, okay. That just I just tell you that, I like the difference in the systems that you're kind of trying to play, right? Most people are playing the banking system, which is all I mean it's it's to say that it's standing on 1 leg is being generous.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:38 PM
 Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's a pretty interesting facts. No doubt, man.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:38 PM
 Yeah.  So that's why I really like what we're doing because real estate and insurance. These are very stable and historically, they've got a lot of, they're, they are heavy weights, even, you know, Wall Street is not as old as insurance or uh, or, um, real estate, right? And so, you know,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:38 PM
 I think when you play in a different when you play in a different system you get to play by different rules and that's that's kind of what we set up here.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:38 PM
 Oh, I can tell. Yeah.  Yeah, that is pretty interesting information. Yeah, Wall Street, I told you not to use the W word around me. Yeah. Good old Wall Street.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:38 PM
 Give you give, you heart palpitations.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:38 PM
 That's fantastic.  Yeah. Wall Street. Oh no, I hate roller coasters. Oh my God.  So yeah, Andy like I say I want to I want to, you know, on another call, I'd like to uh get some things changed on my account, you know, like the dates of dispersement and I need to get uh, maybe some of the amounts. I don't know. And after you were just talking about that, I don't know if we can get any of the amounts changed, you know, I could get like an even number, you know, and or maybe change I don't really want to change the um,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:38 PM
 so,  Yep.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:39 PM
I'm still trying to understand or figure out, you know what I want to be and it's based on kind of what I want my budget and my cash flow to be at. It's nice to have all these kind of problems with this kind of cash, you know, or whatever. It's really, really not bad at all. Because I sure wouldn't have been in the shape 7 years ago and all this stuff started. But anyway, you know, it's kind of minor stuff. But I can't, I've gone in and I'm going now. I'm going to have to have Andy help me with this, you know, like I say even on the a to even get it started, I don't know. I don't I just don't know what buttons to push, you know, based on everything, they've got their butt.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:39 PM
 Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:39 PM
 That's fine. Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh yeah. Well, you shouldn't  Yeah, well, whenever you're ready, let me let me know when you're ready. And I'll, I'll just prepare everything for you and I'll get it all lined out for you. You don't have to go, you don't have to go, look at their website. I can, I can pull exactly what we need and get it all prepared, and then we can walk through it together.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:39 PM
 You know.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:40 PM
 All right, well, I will do good a job as I can, you know?

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:40 PM
 Jim Jim. I'm I am I am full service here.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:40 PM
 Well, I know it, dude. And I need to send you some money, dude. Cuz I, you looked at the papers and you've been giving me this information whatever. And I think you should be paid something for it or whatever I mean you don't normally take money or whatever but

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:40 PM
 No. It's it's

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:40 PM
 Anyway. Yeah I know it's a minor thing. I just you know like I just got my uh my um what do you call it? The North American my, my new nudity that I do get. I got it today and it's the first and I'd really like to kind of move that up a couple of days and and where I'm not getting it on the first. Like sometimes I get it on the 2029.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:40 PM
No.  It's all good.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:40 PM
 Right.  Okay.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:40 PM
 9 or 30. But you know if I need to make a mortgage payment, it's kind of cutting a little close and I've already gotten burned back in I think October last year when I expected the money in but because of the way, the weekend Falls and North American, you almost have to light a fire under their butts to get the thing sent and the 28th this time was what Sunday and that's the date. I want to move it like to the 24th. You know what I mean? And and I don't know how to do that within the within the deal or within the website and you know it's just simple stuff like that and then if there's possible to go tomorrow,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:41 PM
 Oh yeah, we need to back.  Yeah. Yeah.  Okay. Yeah. Yeah.  No, I can I can definitely help you.  They're probably they're probably going to want us to. They're probably going to want us to fill out a form. I I hate to tell you

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:41 PM
 Oh God, not another form again. Can I just push a button or 2 and, you know?

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:41 PM
 yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:41 PM
 Send them a, you know, a debit card or something, or here's a gift or whatever. Now, change it around for me or whatever but uh, yeah, that's mainly all it is.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:41 PM
 You can.  No, just don't push the big red button.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:41 PM
 The big red 1, you know, the big red button, the big red 1.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:41 PM
 Yeah, just

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:41 PM
 But uh yeah, that's about it, dude.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:41 PM
 Don't don't press the big red button.  okay, well yeah, let me um

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:41 PM
 That is about it.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:41 PM
 I'll get into North American. And I will, uh, I'll get the right stuff. I'll get the right process. Do you want me to look at? Uh, do you want me to pull any forms for the Athena or do you want to wait until March or uh, probably February for that?

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:41 PM
 Yeah, we can wait until I'm really planning and I've got it in my you know in my spreadsheet that I'm really going to try to wait and I think I can make it weighed. I'm not even going to have bets. Um

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:42 PM
 Um and I'll explain more here in a second and then I'll let you go. I know you probably got other you need to do but uh I um Uh, forgot what I was going to say. Uh, the the um,  The Athenian? Yeah, wait till um, probably late April, not April, probably late, February February. I think is the the anniversary date and then I just want to get it started like in March like the middle of March, I want to try like I think the 15th or whatever I've got it tentatively down and what I was going to do is I'm going to try to work it out to where I can make Beth, wait a full year to where she's at least 66.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:42 PM
 Probably.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:42 PM
 And then she won't start getting her social security. This is I'm talking about her social security and at least it gets her a little bit more. Get your just over 2,000 because if she starts taking it now it isn't much at all plus with them getting ready to take out 185 dollars. And oh by the way did you know that they're projecting Social Security? I mean not Social Security Medicare to jump 11.6% in cost for 2026 yeah it'll go $22 higher 1 185 to 207 and I was only expecting it to go up, you know, 10 bucks and it's going up $22. That's the projection.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:42 PM
 Yeah.  Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:43 PM
 Yeah. Well Well yeah.  The the cost.  The cost too, you know, you know, I don't I don't like the infighting, but sometimes some of the things that the people say, you know, that each side, you know, I don't I don't play, I don't play the game that you're either 1 side or the other. I think that's, I think that's a little false but I did hear something that that I have some experience with my grandfather was a, uh, he was a small town doctor. He was the only doctor in the town that I grew up in so he he was like of an era where

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:43 PM
 Dr. Daniels you talked about him before to me? Yeah Dr. Daniels

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:44 PM
 Dr. Daniels. Yep.  And so, when they made a bunch of cuts to the rural Health Care reimbursements, um, you know, I said, I, I looked at that and I saw, uh, oh, that's a big mistake. Like, why, why in the world would Republicans? You know, and I'm from a small town, like I grew up in the red State, like, so it's not, you know, like I said, it's not a party thing. I'm just trying to Rack my brain. Like guys, these are the people who voted you in. Why are you going to not just take away the health care that we all set up? But why would you destroy their hospitals? Like they're not even going to have anywhere to go to

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:44 PM
 And I just I can't I can't I can't think of it for a reason. Like what's the reason for that, you know? Um,

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:44 PM
 oh, really  That's not right. Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:44 PM
 Yeah. So you know, I saw that in the big beautiful bill that they they really cut back on a lot of the the  a lot of the reimbursements and the payments that rural Healthcare rural rural hospitals, get to participate in and I was like, oh, that is a bold move. You guys, I don't know how that's going to shake out, but

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:45 PM
 Okay, so  So, so that's that's a bad 1 on the Republicans. And so the, the Democrats are telling the truth that they, they are cutting cutting that funding or some of that funding was supposed to be.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:45 PM
For the hospitals, the rural hospitals because I don't know who to believe Andy. I'm telling you, that's why I got to quit watching it. Like you suggested I got to quit because both of them are both of them. Got a good point but 1 1 side or the other is lying. I mean you know

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:45 PM
 yeah.  Well.  That's why.  That's why I can't.  Yeah. Well that's why you know me that's why I got to go read it for myself. I can't I can't listen to The Talking Heads. That drives me crazy because they'll say, you know, the same person. Yeah. It doesn't matter who it is is they they they'll say 1 Thing 1 day and they'll say something completely opposite. The next I'm like well which is it. So I like it in writing because when it's in writing then I there's no misinterpretation and that is 1 thing. I did see in the big beautiful bill is that they're you know and it it's really convoluted too and I I don't expect people to understand this but what happened was they basically

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:45 PM
 Yeah. Yeah.  That's true.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:46 PM
 I think it's, I think it's because they're trying to score political points, which maybe it's a popular thing to do, maybe not. Like I get it, they have to do it, they have to do to State, you know, get elected. But they're so they're so wrapped around the axle about it being called Obamacare. Like who the hell cares whether it was Obama or Biden or George D? Like quit that like, right, who the hell cares you guys? Come on. Um, but they're so wrapped around it.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:46 PM
 Uhuh.  Yeah, really. Really  It, it's the ACA, isn't it? The Affordable Care Act? I mean

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:46 PM
Yes. That's what it actually. That's what it actually is. And, you know, honestly between you and me when that happened, I turned to Mary and I said, oh, this isn't going to be good. Not because I disagree with, you know, affordable health care but because the way that the Democrats did it, they pushed it through without getting bipartisan agreement. They didn't do the work to make sure that it was going to work for all the states and they, um, they they didn't do that. And I said, well that's going to come back to bite them. This is, you know, we all need good health care but that's not the right way to do it.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:46 PM
 Yeah.  Yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:47 PM
 Oh yeah, I remember that now, they were real sneaky about that and it was like what 7008 Pages or whatever it was and

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:47 PM
 Right.  Yeah. Yes. And I was like, why why do you got to do that? Like, you need to do the work and you need to go get go across the aisle and get in agreement and find out. If, you know, if what you think is going to work for Illinois, you got to make sure it works for Alaska. That's the point of the federal government.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:47 PM
 Oh my God.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:47 PM
 Yeah. Yeah, in Hawaii and all, you know, every state,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:47 PM
 so,  I'm not going to tell you that I saw this coming but I do like to read those bills and I've been doing that since I was in high school like I've since I was 15 years old I'll open up the the bills that are currently in Congress so that have just fast and I'll go read through them. So I got in pretty skilled at at reading between the lines and following the trail and what they did was. They're so upset about Obamacare, quote unquote that they went and took a they went and took a machete to the thicket which I'm not going to lie.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:47 PM
 Well, that's something.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:47 PM
 Some of it needed to be done and it needs to be reworked. But 1 thing, I think they might have accidentally caught or not realized that you if they don't have if

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:48 PM
 Think of the expense to get a hospital started. Right and we have a bunch of rural hospitals in the middle of Kansas, in the middle of Oklahoma all over that, you know you got people that have lived in the country like my family's lived in the country for a almost 100 years, right? We're not moving to the city, we're not city Folk so we need we need. Yeah and we need hospitals Farmers more than anybody because they're working around heavy equipment all the time. And um the way that those hospitals get paid is through this really complex reimbursement, scheme, through the Affordable Care Act. And it turns out that it's like 1 of the only ways that the hospitals can actually get money for the work that they do. They don't, they can't they don't get paid directly by the insurance companies by the health insurance companies. That's, that's a really small percentage. Most of it is through the Medicare and the Medicaid and the the reimbursements that they get through the government. So everything kind of goes up to the top.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:48 PM
 Yeah. Right now.  Yeah, not gonna happen. Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:49 PM
 And then it's supposed to flow back down which is really good because, you know, you get these big inner city hospitals, like John's Hopkins or you know, get these major hospitals and their payments go up and then get filtered back down and some of that money gets to go out to the rural hospitals. Great. Well, you got 10 million people in 1 square mile and they're all paying money to get Healthcare right? Give that to some of the people out in the you know, middle of Idaho

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:49 PM
 Okay.  yeah, really

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:49 PM
But they cut it off. And so I'm hoping once they get this, uh, once they get this shutdown thing figured out, I I'm hoping that they will get it fixed before the end of the year. I think there's still time. I think they just needed to get something passed because they wanted some. I wanted some points on the scoreboard which is great but they need to fix that or we're going to be in trouble because it's a lot harder. You don't reopen a hospital, you don't close it down for a year and then go back and reopen it. You have to build a completely new 1.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:50 PM
 Yeah, I would agree with that.  Not that I have on that much experience or whatever with it, but I can see the complexity in it, you know, just by your, you know, meaning a lot of that, that you just did. My God,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:50 PM
 No.  I won't be going to.  Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah I won't be going to any hospitals that had to be reopened right like that that's you don't want to do that. That's a good good recipe for infection. So anyways I'm watching it. I'm kind of I'm kind of worried and confused about what they're trying to do and I'm saying well what's your goal here is your goal to like be effective or is your goal to just stick it to the other side and as long as they're both trying to stick it to each other and not be effective for us.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:50 PM
 Yeah, exactly.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:50 PM
 I'm like, I'm not into that. I'm like, I'm not in it for your  You know, Kink of the mountain battle.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:50 PM
 Right. Wow pretty good information or whatever? Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:50 PM
 So, best thing we can do.  Yeah, best thing we can do is, you know, pay attention to it. Once they make a decision on whatever it is, they think they're going to do. And then we deal with the facts at that point. And in the meantime, we keep growing your income and stocking it away and stashing it away in stockpiling, it wherever you can so that you can deploy it when you need it on your schedule. Not theirs.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:51 PM
 Yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:51 PM
 Well, my savings account is called a life insurance contract. That's where my savings go.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:51 PM
 yeah, you  You got it, access and liquidity and control. That's what, that's what's gonna, you know. You you'll be like a

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:51 PM
That's right.  And I just wish I'd have done it starting in 2008 and not 2018 or whatever that would have been even better. I'd have been rolling in money by now.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:51 PM
 It's oh, and now you can't go can't go backwards but I think you've done a great job of getting things set up and you've got a really good system with your spreadsheets, you know, your I I know that you got, you got the, uh, you've got the projections on lock. So, um,

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:51 PM
 so,  I know.  Oh, I know.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:51 PM
 I just want to, you know,

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:51 PM
 Yeah. But there, there, there also there, what do you call it? There, they're not locked in or what do you call etched in stone? You know what I mean? I mean, I've got room to move and do different things if I need to. Like, I've already thrown money in their extra in the budget side. In in case the health care really does go up, you know, 100% or whatever. They're claiming, it might go up, you know. Um I've got it in there and all that does Andy is that it just lowers my cash flow, that's the only place it hurts. It really does. So I could handle it. I don't want to have to handle it, but if I had to, I can, you know,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:51 PM
 Right. Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:52 PM
 Yeah.  Well, the good thing is too Jim.  Right. Yeah.  And we got a plan to grow that. So even if you had to even if you had to take that money out of your pocket today, 3 or 4 years from now, we've got a way to get more money into your pocket. So the ultimate the end result isn't going to be that painful. It might be painful for some of your friends that don't know about this. But you know what to each his own

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:52 PM
 Yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:52 PM
You know what Migo? I tried to tell him, you know, I go, you need to call this guy right here and then I I got you supposed to hear from the lady that that lived across the street where she used to live across the street from Lael before laelle moved. She lived in the rental alarm, Bell lived in the rental house. Remember and then we sold it and remember Marcela over there. We sold that last year when she lived right across the street and she lived there a long time but she's coming up on 70 in December but she still working and she's getting their social security and I guess she's I don't know if she's on Medicare or not but she's got a buku of money that's in her field but there's some stipulations to it. I said, you need to talk to Andy. I mean she's wanting to retire because she might want to work till 72 or whatever. I go. You need to talk to him so that he can give you options on what to do with that so that you're not left holding the bag and going with a big question mark, what am I going to do? So, you know, I I get

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:52 PM
 I know.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:53 PM
 Uh, yeah.  Yes, yes. Yes.  Okay.  Oh my goodness.  Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:53 PM
 Right.  Oh, that. Yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:53 PM
 Over your your car. I had a car to use around here. I think it's all still correct. It's got your home number on it. I think the the only 1 you that you ever gave to me

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:53 PM
Oh yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:53 PM
 The it's the sure. Sure. Well not sure. Well Solutions, wealth coach I think is what it said on it. Anyway, I gave her your card and

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:54 PM
 That that phone number should still work.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:54 PM
 Yeah, she she's gonna talk to her. Uh yeah. Wealth, coach, Safe, Money Solutions, Andy Daniels your agent licensed. And then you got a, it's a 8165856066 and then your address.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:54 PM
 Yep, that works. Yeah well you know Jim if they don't call

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:54 PM
 Yeah, that's you gave me a whole packet of them. And I I've got like maybe 1 or 2 levels because I give a lot of them out. But anyway, you know, I, I was trying to we that she's the latest person we talked to and she was with us tonight, September 5th, when we were all at Olive Garden and you know, I was treating everybody and, uh, she was, you know, telling me that she had, she had like, over 500 K or whatever and I'm going you need to talk to Andy. I go, he can help you put that in places where, you know, you can defer it or whatever. I go. I don't, you know, I can't quite, you know, explain the exactness of what you can do because he's the guy that knows how to do work with all of that. So, you know, I'm I want to say expect the phone call but, uh, he's got to talk to her Merril Lynch.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:54 PM
 That that's on them.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:54 PM
 Oh yeah.  Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:55 PM
 Well, what's her? Uh, what's her  What's her name?

Her name is uh, her name is Pam. Pamela. And her last name is Scott. Pam, Scott.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:55 PM
 Okay.  Okay.  All right. Well yeah. If you have her address, if you have her address, if you have her address, give me your address. I'll send her 1 of my books as a gift from you, and I'll just put in the letter. That it's that it's from Jim and I'll send her a book as a gift from you. And uh, you know, I'll let her read it because she goes to her mirror Lynch guy. He's gonna say, no, I don't listen to that. I want your money in the market where I can make 1, I can make 2%, whether it wins or loses.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:55 PM
 but uh,  I think she's still working.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:55 PM
 Okay.  Yeah, of course.  yeah, but but the thing is, is that she can only get  What was it? Uh,  12,000 per year.  Each year off or something, I don't know. I don't know how that is or whatever.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:55 PM
Okay.  On on 500,000. Oh my God. That what is what is

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:55 PM
 Well, it's like 5:38 it was and it's a lot of it is ESOP, you know, employee stock option, purchase, uh, money or something. Like I say, I don't know. I'm like about it. I remember, I dealt with an ESOP back when I worked at k91, Radio, when I first moved here to Tulsa the 40 years ago,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:56 PM
 Jim, that's like 2 and a half.  That's like yeah, that's like 2 and a half percent like that. Guy's  Not for himself.  If I came back, there was like, Jim. You gotta only take 2% of your money this year. I know you're, I know you're you got a lot, but you can only, I'm trying to imagine that conversation like it would be silly. You think I was joking.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:56 PM
 Oh, I know I know.  Yeah, it's I said you just need to talk to Andy, I go. I don't know. I, you know, and then bed has mentioned. She said, yeah, my friend Paula at work who moved to Memphis. She's she got into that and um, and and Andy's helped her and got her set up and go. And she had, she came over to talk to back on Labor Day on the first of September, and, and had lunch with bevs and lbel over at the. I don't know, downtown culture 1 of the little restaurants, but she just was over for the, for the day or whatever and and was, you know, seeing old friends. And she's living with her parents, whatever and over in Memphis and whatever. But yeah, apparently, she's glad she did it, you know? And like, and like I told, I told Pam, I said, it's not for everybody, I said, but, you know, Andy can tell you, you know, 1 way or the other if he can help you or not, you know, once you once you start working with him, you know.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:57 PM
 oh,  oh good. Yeah.  Oh awesome.  Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:57 PM
Yeah well she's oh my gosh, Jim. She's she's only in her.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:57 PM
 Only in her 30s, she's gonna be. I mean

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:57 PM
 Well, that's easy. I don't know if he's real young, man. He's younger than you are. Yeah, he's younger than my daughter. My youngest daughter. Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:57 PM
 Yeah.  Yep.  Yeah. So  So well, I appreciate it. Yeah. And you know what? I ought to

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:57 PM
 This dude I tried to tell people about it. They go, you know. Yeah. Okay but yeah, I gave all my away but I'll get a regress. It's probably going to be a little a little bit number different from the old address that we have because she lives like diagonally across the street. From our old rental house, which I sold it and now, I don't know Mexicans own it. Now, who the hell knows? I don't care. I got my money and I got my tax, write off on it and I got a hell of a lot of it.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:57 PM
 Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:58 PM
 Yeah. Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  I'll um,  there you go.  Yeah, well I'll send her.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:58 PM
 so that's all done and over with, and

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:58 PM
 I'll send her 1 of my books that I've got and I'll just put in the letter that it's from you and Beth as a gift. And uh, you know, we'll let her read it, you know, maybe it'll change your mind, maybe she doesn't want anything to do with it. If she doesn't, I just have more brain space to work on your stuff.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:58 PM
 Now, there you go but you've got quite a brain, dude. I mean, I'll yeah, I'll find that out, you know. Um, I don't I could, I'm trying to think of what it would be, but I don't know for sure it's going to be 2 or 3 numbers and if she lives on the other side of the street or whatever. But um, yeah, I was going to say, I don't have any books, you know, I gave them all away.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:58 PM
Yeah. Well, if you're poking If you're poking.  A, yeah, if you're poking around on Google Maps, uh just go to the street view and walk down the street.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:58 PM
Hello. I forgot. I got my computer on right here and get off my spreadsheet every blank computer there. Yeah, there we go. Google Maps is right under my retirement, analyzer icon. There it is. Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:59 PM
 Yeah.  Aha, there you go.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:59 PM
 Google Maps.  You can just bear me a second here and I'll just give it to you right now.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:59 PM
 Oh yeah, no worries.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:59 PM
 And let's see here. Okay.  Roll up.  Go over here to  the office of 401 Street at 3369 was the uh,  Yeah, it's in. Here was the rental house address.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:59 PM
 And you said a name with her name was Pamela, Scott.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:59 PM
 hers is  P. Yeah. Pam Scott, Pam Scott p. A m s, c, o, t t, she lives at 3372,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:59 PM

 South.  140th.  East Avenue.  South 140th with a THC Avenue and it's e, you know, and then Ave, but yeah, I'm looking at it right now, Google Maps.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 05:59 PM
 140th East.  Yeah.  All right. Well yeah, I'll get a books then out to her and I uh I forgot that I had sent you some business cards and I forgot that I sent you some books, I'll put in an order and get you some more. So you just have some on hand. I I love that.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 05:59 PM
 That was.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:00 PM
 Yeah, I got, like I said, I got this here that I keep here on my computer, on my laptop on the gonna keep it open all the time. But uh, I, I guess I'll give it a mile away. You sent me? Oh, this was years ago, right? At the beginning, I think before you even solution I guess.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:00 PM
 yeah, well, I remember I remember sending you the uh  I remember sending you the, some of the rough drafts of the book that I was working on. So I think it's about time for me to

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:00 PM
 And I still have that. I still have that.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:00 PM
 I think it's about time for me to start working on another 1 because I got, I got a whole different host of questions and problems that people want me to solve now. So I'm gonna put my brain on it and see if I can figure it out. Yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:00 PM
 Yeah.  oh, really  How are things going with you and Scott? I mean if you got a minute to whatever we could talk about it later, I just hope you know that's not escalating into something worse, you know.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:00 PM
 oh well, I got  No, no, no. I it's all I mean, I haven't talked to him, I don't know what happened. He went off, kind of went off the edge there and, you know, got all upset about me.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:00 PM
 Went off the deep end.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:01 PM
 Yeah, about me taking his business and I'm like, I'm not trying to take your business. Dude, I thought we were working together like I don't know what, I don't know what the deal is but um  What happened was last year after, he told me to take everything, he said, you just take it. I'm retiring, I'm done. I, I mean, I didn't think anything of it except I tried to get him not to and, uh, that was in June. And so I waited until November, right? I, I waited 4 or 5 months, just to make sure he was really sure. And then I, I said, well, you know, if I own it, I probably should get a copyright on the book. I should probably get, you know, a trademark and, you know, all the stuff. So I went and applied for the copyright on the book and, you know, got that. So now I'm just waiting for the trade trademark application to go through, and, you know, it can take a year or so for that to process fully. So I think in the next, you know, probably by the end of December, I should be able to say like, oh,

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:01 PM
 Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:01 PM
I legally owned sharewealth and you know, I don't have to change a name and I can do what I want.  So I haven't heard I haven't heard hide nor hair from him, so I think he really was done, maybe he tried to change his mind and just didn't feel like he could ask me. Because if he had just been nice and said, hey dude, I want back in, I'm sorry. I you know, got a little weird but let's, you know, let's keep working. I I would have said yes. I would have said like sure. Yeah, no no big deal.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:02 PM
 Wow.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:02 PM
Whoa.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:02 PM
 but,  So no, I think it's all going to work out. I just I gotta I gotta wait I gotta wait on the government for a couple more months and of course, they're not processing anything now so I'm sure it's going to extend that time frame just a little bit longer. But whatever, I've already waited this long, it doesn't really matter.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:02 PM
 Whoa.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:02 PM
 So so I guess that is what it is. I I have no ill will towards them. I'm just kind of confused.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:02 PM
 Yeah I I can see what you mean. I kind of like you did kind of go off the deep end and then He barked and you know changed his mind but he just didn't handle it. Like did it very well? I mean not even in a human way. Sounds like it or whatever. Not the type of Master in Duncan ISM. But I'm, you know, I've seen a few movies where, you know, it's like you don't treat people like that or whatever business or in you know, social situations or whatever.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:02 PM
 Yeah.  Right. Yeah, I mean he could have just come back and said, you know, sorry about that that

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:03 PM
 Yeah, yeah, so I I haven't heard much from him so I which is I'm fine with that. Like I don't need to, I don't need to focus on that, you know, trying to get the kids trying to teach him how to read and write, and arithmetic, and all that stuff. And then got to keep the business afloat and you know, I'm still, I'm still jet lagged from Spain. I think I've taken 2 naps today.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:03 PM
 Wow.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:03 PM
Oh, hey, zip code for for Pam's. It's 7, my 1 Ste 74136 hers is 74134.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:05 PM
 Yeah, right.  He's not, you know what?  You know what, you just put the cat on the logo for Scottish, maid, and, and pay the cat, a modeling fee. And the cat is a model for your business.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:05 PM
 Right.  Well you know she goes out, we'll go down here with a little sad Boy Restaurant and have breakfast and she ran into a girl that just had a beautiful, you know, look to her and she said well you put on these earrings so I could take a picture of it. So she could put it on her Scottish page or whatever. And then she came back in favor of a free pair of earrings or something and or 16 wanted her to try something or whatever, try something on. And then she used her as a model that she came back and gave her a gave her a a pair of earrings the next day. You know, when she went home to get them or whatever. And that's how she, and gave her a business card, because she got business cards, she gives out and she she's getting real good at that and we enjoy writing off. Scottish names on the taxes man.

 Yeah, I just think you know it's been 15 years. My the doggies are fit. Oh no. They're 16 years old now and they just they don't they don't do well in the cold. So I was thinking like when it's time to let them out, go get them, you know, put some little booties on them and a little sweater and make sure they stay warm.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:06 PM
 Wow.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:06 PM

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:07 PM
 Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:07 PM
 Yeah, I wanted to, I wanted to see if you if you have that uh if you've got that in your repertoire that I could get some uh little jackets and booties for them.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:07 PM
 I certainly can.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:07 PM
 Oh my gosh, that would be so great.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:07 PM
 Um,  I actually, uh, down in Holdenville, they have a  Uh, it's a spaghetti and no balls dinner every year.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:08 PM
 Uh,

 To support the animal shelter there.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:08 PM
Oh yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:08 PM
 And I did a, I did a dog sweater and I did a bunch of dog blankets. I took fleece and put them over old pillows.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:08 PM
 Yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:08 PM
And my brother said that they went really, the blankets went really well because I had Casey and Dallas Cowboy, uh, fleece that I used. He goes, of course, you know, buy for myself.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:08 PM
 So yeah, I have I'll look and find the pattern. I need to know their sizes because if I'm doing it for a specific dog I want to make sure I get the correct size for them.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:08 PM
 And 1 of them's quite a bit smaller than the other. How what what do I measure?

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:08 PM
 Yeah, I was gonna say I need the I I need to know.  I'll just send you the information that I need.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:08 PM
 Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, just text me. Yes. Yeah I can I can measure them up.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:08 PM
 okay, so from the neck, from the neck to the  Yeah, the neck to where you want it to hit on.  Custom dogs, don't like it near their business. You know, I have. Well, I had a friend that she didn't realize that every time she put it on, put on a little vest for her dog, that she was putting the velcro where it rubbed raw on the dog.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:09 PM
 Right. Right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:09 PM
 Oh yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:09 PM
 And I mean, the dog would go and grab the thing as soon as it got off and try and bury it. And I said you've got something that's not sitting, right? And it was the velcro to take that velcro off and put a snap faster on there. I said you won't have any problems anymore.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:09 PM
 Oh my gosh.  Yeah. Oh good. Well, yeah. My mine are pretty snuggly at this stage. I was telling Jim, they're 16 years old, and they hate the winter time. So I thought it'd be really nice to get them some, you know, like booties or a jacket or like sweater or something. And I'm like, I know just the

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:09 PM
 Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:09 PM
 Person who can make 1.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:09 PM
 They need a little hats too, you know, keep their little house coat warm.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:09 PM
 Yeah. Oh my God, that would be so cute.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:09 PM
 I have P. Well, I've got a pattern for a cat birthday hat, and I've got patterns for, uh, crowns and everything. So, yeah, well there

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:10 PM
 Oh my God, the kids the kids will love it so much. They will love getting the doggies dressed up to go out in the morning.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:10 PM
 Big deal.  But yeah, actually that

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:10 PM
 Well thank you. Well I hope you yeah, I hope you feel. I hope you're feeling okay. Jim said you got a bug going around.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:10 PM
 Well, I went to the dentist yesterday and I normally get gas.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:10 PM
 oh,

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:10 PM
 And I sat through the whole thing thinking, what is this gas is just not affecting now?  And I think it's just a nervous stomach afterwards because I got a sore on my mouth and I could because I, I told him I said, hold it. I said this, this is really hurting. I even felt the needle go in, so I should have known then that with the filling, the needle going, what's going on?

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:10 PM
 Yeah.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:10 PM
 But after it was all done, he looked over. And he goes oh Beth! I'm so sorry. He goes. I didn't even remember to turn the gas on. He goes, you've been breathing oxygen. The same time. I said, well, that's okay. I said, I mean, I can do it but I don't want to do that again.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:10 PM
 Oh my  gosh.  But now your nervous system is all freed from getting worked on without the right stuff. Oh, that's the worst. Well,

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:11 PM
 Yeah.  Yeah, I'm just kind of like oh this is not good. And of course, the first thing I was worried about is getting billed for that 88 dollars. That you have to pay separately for the gas, but she didn't get it. So make sure they take that off the bill, you know.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:11 PM
Yeah, right. Well. Um yeah good. Good thing though.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:11 PM
And oh by the way, these a little better now, you know, whatever.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:11 PM
 Good thing. You don't got any work tomorrow so you could just sleep in.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:11 PM
 That's right, that's right. If she's enjoying that.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:11 PM
 Yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:11 PM
 Go, I'm telling you what, man, if you loving that, I've been doing a lot.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:11 PM
 You better not set an alarm you better. You you're required to turn off the alarm clock for the first 6 months.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:11 PM
 Are you have it go off and then I'm like, yeah, screw that. You

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:11 PM
 Yes, I love it for you. Oh, that's so good.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:11 PM
 Really, really cool thing that I do and Mary might want to do it for the girls. Um, I go to Walmart and get their their 6 dollar uh blankets now but she may even want to do it for yourself but you can't

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:12 PM
 Oh, that is a good idea.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:12 PM
 fold it in half and slice out a little bit of the neck and then Stitch it down and you've got a poncho made  And then since the girls know how to knit, they can knit themselves a cow or a scarf to go with it or a hat or fingerless mittens.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:12 PM
 Oh, that would be such a good idea. And Hazel got a um hazel got like a little miniature sewing machine for Christmas last year and so we she has it. She's wanted to get it started and I just haven't had a chance to help her get it set up yet. I'm like all right if you guys can read the instructions to get it set up like and so I think we're gonna pull that out for the winter time activities. We've got everything we need for knitting crocheting sewing. Um, when Joann's went out of business Mary and I went I we

 If they pay 3,000, we'll see. I thought I had overpriced myself last year and this person would say, no, they that was too much money.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:16 PM
 Uh,

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:16 PM

I said you just go in and take da da da, and everything will be okay. And he comes back, he goes I'm not ready. Ready? For this kind of crap.

 Haunted whole house.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:21 PM
 Haunted, hold house. Oh my goodness, you guys. Well we had a good conversation Beth we got. I think we got our game plan. I hate to tell you, it's going to involve some paperwork but we've we've we've come, we've come to terms with the amount of paperwork we're gonna have to do.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:21 PM
 Yeah.  And that's okay.  Okay, okay, I'm good with paperwork, you know.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:22 PM
 Yeah.  Yeah, so other than that, um, yeah, so okay, I think we got everything. Um, if you want to just text me whenever you figure out about the, uh, you know, the little dog, things, whatever measurements you need and I'm happy to pay fair market value, whatever, whatever we need to do because I I do want them and I'd rather buy them from you.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:22 PM
Can you get the family discount?  You get the family discount man.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:22 PM
 I'd rather.  I'd rather get them from you than some 5 Below store or something.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:22 PM
 I know I I told L, I said Pinterest has killed craft shows.  because Pinterest and pamper chef and tupperware because people set up their  you know, um,  Different.  Already made things and sell them at craft shows and then Pinterest. I saw that on Pinterest. I can make that you walk away from the booth and say that you don't say it right there in front of the people that works, you know.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:22 PM
 Yeah.  oh,  Right. Oh my gosh.  Yeah. Well

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:22 PM
 40 years kind of hard to do this stuff.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:23 PM
 yeah, but you know what people that say that hey I'll bet 90% of them will never go do it. They won't even go try to do it and the other 10% will try to do it and then they will realize just how much effort and practice it actually takes.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:23 PM
 I had a sign on my older sister took it out of my bed. She told me it was ready to put it there. I said and on the sign it said I know you can and I know you would but you should buy it from me and give yourself the gift.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:23 PM
That's a that's not rooted at all.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:23 PM
 And somebody ask you what I meant. I said, give yourself the time of being with your family rather than trying to recreate something. You saw how to craft shows and they were like, oh that's true. And they bought from me and Elsie says that is so rude to have that out there. The lordville liked it, she said that was a good idea.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:23 PM
 Yeah.  I think I like that. I don't think it the wrong way, I think, I think it's a great way to say to remind people, like you're probably not gonna do this.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:24 PM
Barbells myself.  it was after we had,  Uh, done the Rich Dad, Poor Dad, the Robert Kiyosaki thing, and he said, I could fix that. But my time was my family is worth more than the forty dollars. It costs us a bail. Fix it for me. I thought. There you go. That's my explanation right there, you know. Yeah, I might add Andy that. Yeah, Robert Kiyosaki was our first attempt at developing a retirement system or whatever. And that was, in the early days I was, what? 20 2000, not 2007 or 2008, it was 2008. I got the rental house. That's right. Yeah, and then 10 years later, I met you, you know, over the

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:24 PM
 Yes, yes.  yeah, just  just because I can doesn't mean I should.  Yeah.  Uh, huh.  Oh yeah, yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:24 PM
 I don't know through through the bank on yourself. Um, I can't remember now how we did it, if something something I saw online or I got got 1 of Pam yellen's books, he could have sent a book for him. Oh okay, great. Thank you. And I got it, gave him gave him her address, okay. So and

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:24 PM
Yeah, Banker.  Yeah, I'll just send her a book but no I I yeah I remember uh you guys telling me that you had done some Robert Ki and I love Robert Kiyosaki for sure. I think

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:25 PM
 And we did, too.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:25 PM
 I think he didn't tell the I don't he didn't tell the whole story because he should have had stuff about it Insurance in there because I know now that's how all the real estate people are doing it.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:25 PM
well, you know, like I said, we bought 1 house and  It was a blessing in disguise because that was the house. My mom had died in. Lar belts old house, and her dad were struggling, and the girl said the person, they had, rented the house from us to buy moved out in the middle of the night. We go over to check the damage and everything and L said, here you go. Jim, here's my first month's rent, my last month's rent, and get my current month's rent, and then then they moved in and then ended up staying there 16 years. Yeah, yeah, it was.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:25 PM
 Oh my gosh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh my gosh.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:25 PM
 A blessing in disguise, you know.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:25 PM
 Yeah, seems like it worked out. It worked out for you guys in larell and and yeah, it was just good. Well, you know, all this stuff, everything happens for a reason, you know, the timeline is what it is and

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:26 PM
 Yeah.  You know, it.  There you go.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:26 PM
 Jim Jim was joking that he should have started this 10 10 years earlier but you know what? We are where we are right now and you guys have done a great job getting where you've got

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:26 PM
 Yeah.  And you know, you weren't doing it.  What 20, 20 years ago. So, therefore it is it is what it is because we would have stuck with them and not met you. And I I like talking with you and thinking of you as 1 of my other kids, you know?

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:26 PM
 right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:26 PM
Oh, I love that. I love that. Well, and that's why I told

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:26 PM
 Everybody always seemed like the coolest mom, the our daughter married. A man that wants to be a woman and his mom is married to a woman and she goes, I would be such a cool gay mom and I thought well number 1. You are a gay mom. And number 2, you have a son that wants to be a woman. So you kind of but you need to be a little bit nicer to the kids, you know.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:26 PM
 oh,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:26 PM
 right. Right.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:26 PM
It's not my way of life but they're happy. So that's all that matters is that they're happy, you know.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:27 PM
 oh my  there. There you go. Yep, yep.  Well, no, I I was telling Jim, you guys have done a good job and I appreciate every conversation and Jim was like, oh, I'll let you go. And I'm like, you know what, when I know that I'm going to talk to you guys. Mary knows like the kids know who you guys are. They're like, oh Dad's on the phone with Jim and Beth, don't you know? Don't bug him. Don't f*** him. Like, you know, they they love it. So we we can't wait to eventually get together with you guys. So we will get down to Oklahoma or maybe we can meet up in Arkansas.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:27 PM
 If you if the girls are married or Fritz, have any questions on crafts that I might be able to help, you know, I'm 24/7.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:27 PM
 Yeah, you have to get up and go to work in the morning. Now I just, I had a boss fight next to my last boss. He was telling everybody at 1 of the meetings, when we were  Changing into a new system, he goes, I never have an issue calling Beth anytime day or night, no matter what the day is because she's, she's always there to help me. And they the other girls were like, oh no, and my phone goes off at 9:00 and I better call me. He goes, I called her at 1 morning and she was like, yes sir just give me 15 minutes. I'll get it done. Because then she calls the then, she texts me back and lets me know it's done. And she'll see me at 7:00 in the morning.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:28 PM
Oh my gosh.  That is a.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:28 PM
 And he says he's actually already. So you know, what do you call that dedication? They were like, no stupidity.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:28 PM
 It's just being responsible. That's I mean it it just that's what it is. You don't get that with young kids today, they're that's unheard of

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:28 PM
 And I was like,  yeah.  Well, now that I've left, they've all got company cell phones, paid for. They get overtime any time they get a call. I said, I should have gotten paid all that crap to begin with, you know, some of it, you did. I mean, yeah. With Brandon, with Brandon and cookie I did, uh, cookie had called and he said, hey, can you tell me? So, and so's birthday. I said, no, but give me a few minutes to try and check it out.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:29 PM
 Oh, okay, okay.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:29 PM

 Oh my gosh.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:29 PM
 That's uh and that's not my first 1 but that was the first 1 that I was at the hospital with him and while it was his wife and father and with the other guy that had found him because he goes, I kept popping and he didn't answer and he goes I went over there and there he was laying on it. What was that on the Monday of that last week before you took the vacation that Friday? Yeah. You started on vacation? Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:30 PM

Man. Yeah.  July. Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:30 PM
 Oh my gosh, wow. Yeah, you gotta be careful with those. You gotta be careful with those energy drinks. I, uh, I have 1, every once in a while, but I never have more than 1 in a day. Like, I would never

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:30 PM
 It was yeah.  Yeah, I can't. I can save a coffee. I can't drink them, they make me jittery. They don't taste me at all. It's like a drink, you know, like a pop or something. So I just don't even drink them anymore.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:30 PM
 Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. I mean if it if it doesn't give you a little kick then what are you spending the money for you might as well have tea or something else that you like most of them. I think tastes like battery acid. If I, if I could imagine what battery acid tasted like,

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:30 PM
 Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah.  Monster you know. Oh man is all kinds of them, okay, different brands and crazy.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:30 PM
 Right. Yeah, no. Thank you. I'll drink. I'll drink water. That's what we do in our house. We don't, we don't have a lot of drinks. We drink water. That's, that's just what we do. So,

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:30 PM
 Yeah.  Hey, you know, and we do too. I mean, I don't really drink a lot of Pop, I like coffee, but that's water. And then she likes tea a lot. I drink iced tea through the summer, mainly, but water, mainly and I like mocha and, you know, coffee drinks. So, I probably drink more than that back starts hurting. It's like, oh, time to drink some more, water level it out, you know.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:31 PM
 Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:31 PM
 but,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:31 PM
 Go float in the pool for a minute.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:31 PM
 That yeah it's too bloody cold to get in that water. Now I'm gonna get it covered here in a few weeks.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:31 PM
 Have you have you shut her? Have you shut her down? Have you shut her down for the season yet?

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:31 PM
 Now about 2 more weeks. So I'm gonna I gotta have a guy look at the house Friday and then I'm gonna have a have the pool guys come out. I think probably on the 13th or 14th of October on that 1 of those days and have them cover it, you know. And that's, that's pretty quick. Convenient, little shutdown have young guys. Can, you know, muscle around with that cover and put it on and 350 bucks for the tire shutdown and I'm good till April, you know?

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:31 PM
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:31 PM
 Then it's done for and you don't have to worry about it. Hopefully, they warranty it just

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:31 PM
 You have for like 6 months? Yeah, take care of it, pretty fast. Well, say Andy, I'm gonna, I'm gonna text you that information on the North American Annuities. Uh, for what I'd like to try to do, you know? And

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:32 PM
 Yeah, yeah. That's good.  That's good.  Okay.  Yep. Yeah, just give me the list and I'll go, I'll go hunt down, you let me hunt down all the forms. You don't need to worry about that. Just because you can doesn't mean you should remember that.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:32 PM
 Give you the information on that.  Well true and I I appreciate it again. You got baby, you got. Yeah I mean you got your hands full dude. But what a beloved family you have for sure. Uh but yeah, I mean it's it's probably minor stuff to you.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:32 PM
I know, they're they're getting big and they're  they're ramping up so I can I can definitely help you with that. Just give me the list of what you want me to look for or what you're trying to do, I'll go find the forms and get them prepped for you.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:32 PM
 it's, it's  Well, I'll send it to you in an email that way if you need to look at it on your computer and, you know, while your phone's free or whatever like that and that way you can hold it on a monitor or whatever. Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:32 PM
 Okay.  Yeah, I might  I might have to call them too because it is very it is like complex. So a lot of times as an agent. I have a direct line where I can get an answer quickly so that that's usually that's usually what it is. It's not that it takes me a lot of time. It's just that they give me access to like a back door where I don't have to like fumble around with stuff.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:33 PM
 Oh, sure. Well  All right. Well, on a typical answer is it possible to, I mean, do you get request or is it? Do you know that it's possible to get a different amount change? You know of for what you're with withdrawal is going to be or is that already etched in stone?

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:33 PM
 You know, all the way out.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:33 PM
 Um, the um, the amount is similar, I believe we can lower it lightly, so if it's like, you know, if if it's if you want it, if it's at, like, you know, 972 and you want it to be 970. I we could probably lower it pretty easily. Um,

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:33 PM
 No.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:33 PM
 But I'll I'll find out from them. I, I have a way to ask. I, I know who to call to ask about that pretty quickly.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:33 PM
 Okay, well, I didn't want to bump it up too much. I mean, because I know it's all, you know, planned out for you know, another 30 years or whatever and part of what, you know, all the variables that you were talking about earlier, that made a lot of good sense but I'll just send it to you what I want. But yeah, if you could get the get the date dispersement date or with, you know, that they send it and make that a little earlier in the month. Yeah. I I definitely want that.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:34 PM
Okay.  We should be able to do that. Yeah, we should definitely be able to do that.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:34 PM
 I want to move it up for days, go from the 28th to the 24th and uh but I'll I'll send that to you in an email here in a little while and

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:34 PM
 Okay.  Here's the thing.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:34 PM
 Other than that, much much appreciated amigo. I'm glad you guys had a good time. Yeah, they went to Spain. He said they went to Philadelphia and then he had to go to Dallas first and then he went to Philadelphia and then it was 9 hours straight to Spain.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:35 PM
 Yeah, I I actually I had Mary, I printed out 3 copies of her passport. Um, well, what really happened was we it was uh probably like the second. It was probably like September 15th and we were booking the tickets to go over and uh, I just happened to open up Mary's passport and I saw that it expired on it was August 15th. And I saw that her passport expired on September 10th and we were supposed to leave on September 23rd, so I had to get her new passport expedited, and we were worried it wasn't going to be there but luckily, it didn't take too long and then I got it. I got I got copies of it and I went to the bank and we got a notoriousedc.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:37 PM
 Glad we do, yeah.  Yeah, that's exactly right. Last year was 2020 into 2021. We had everything booked paid for the whole bit.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:37 PM

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:37 PM
 And everybody had refunded me money except for this 1 guy. And he was saying that he knew the restaurant that I was talking about that his family owned it.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:37 PM
 Uh, huh.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:37 PM

And I said you've got somebody booked in our tour week but we'll work it out. I said no. I said I'm right now I I wrote uh Airbnb, I said okay this is going on, is it not anymore? It's not so they got hold of him and you know told him we don't do this.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:37 PM
 Right.  What?  Yeah.  Uh,  yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:38 PM
 I went to the restaurant. I said you guys know. So and so and they said we wish he would quit telling people he's associated with us, we do not know him, he has no relation to us, you know? And what's cool is when you go to some of these places and they remember you from past visits, you know, and the guy was like, I think I waited on you before I said

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:38 PM
 Uh,  oh my gosh.  Uhuh.  Yes. Yeah. Well I mean they're small. They're small businesses.

 People like, you are so hard because they can forget because you're so friendly. I thought, well, that's not really exactly how I would have put it, but okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:38 PM
 Okay. But that's really, that's a really nice thing. You can go back all the way around the world and have somebody. Remember you for how kind they felt like you were being? That's really impressive. That is good.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:38 PM

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:38 PM

 Yeah, you should be but obviously it's not yeah. Yeah, when we went in 2021, I took 60 pairs of fingerless mittens and we gave them all away.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:39 PM
 Yeah.  Oh my gosh.  Really.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:39 PM

I am Beth and she goes, my mother still wears that Shaw. She goes, she needed to everybody and she goes when she saw it. She said, this is almost as good as my knitting, and she kept it for herself. She goes, I never even got a chance to look at it.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:39 PM
 Oh,  uh, huh.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:39 PM
So but you know, it kind of makes you feel good. Yeah. That was 2014 to 2021 so 7 years.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:40 PM
 That's so crazy.  Oh, yes, absolutely.  Oh my gosh.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:40 PM

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:40 PM
 Yeah, well, I love I decided, I like traveling the world. I already, I already like traveling but I really had a great time and Mary and I decided together, you know, she's still over there, she's on a, she's on a

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:40 PM
 45 foot sailboat, sailing around the, the Balearic Islands doing yoga. And, you know, talking to people and everything.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:40 PM
 Oh, the tall ships.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:40 PM
 Yes, yeah, it's a it's a sailing ship and so but we both decided, this was just our exploratory trip. This was just for us to get our feet wet. Now, we got to go back with the kids and we got to show them all the cool spots and then see all the stuff that we didn't see before. And

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:40 PM
 Yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:40 PM
 Mine started when I was 13 years old, I was 12 and turned 13 that year.  and uh,  My uncle would come home and because we went in the summertime. We went June to July for 6 weeks and he would come home and he would take us in the evenings as soon as he got off because the sun was still up.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:41 PM
 And so the beaches would go to castles, we go to such and such this was before castles were owned by the historic Scotland or by National Trust so you could go in any time.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:41 PM
 Oh my gosh. Yeah.  Right. It was a little more open. It was more open at that time. Yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:41 PM
 Oh yeah.  and,  Then I went 83 by myself, 86 with my mom and I told my cousin he goes. Where are we taking your mom? I said, well Harry. I said, she's never been to such and such such and such and such and such

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:41 PM
 And she told me she could tell you. I'm not traveled worthy over there, I said no mama, I said he's wanting to make sure you get to places.  So we went you know, and he'd come, I got he worked for beneficials because I got to go get a debt collection and so it was. Okay, so we all pile into the car and go, you know, we go chop the town around or go see castles or whatever and so in 2000 I told Jim I said now.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:41 PM
 Mhm.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:42 PM
 This is how it happens. I said we go over. I said the families there.  They are so good to us, you know, and the 1, the 1 on Coletta say was him. And  Then in 80 uh 2003 Gemini went by ourselves with the kids and that was a blast cuz that was winter time. That was right at Thanksgiving. We just pulled the kids out of school. They were out 4 days anyway and we went to TGI Friday for in Glasgow for Thanksgiving and well it was just a St Andrews night over there. Well, that was 5 days later. Oh 5 days.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:42 PM
Oh yeah.  Yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:42 PM
 To.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:42 PM
 Oh, that's so fun.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:42 PM
 Pay the entry side. It was a blast. We went to that country dance.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:42 PM
 Oh my gosh.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:42 PM
 Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:42 PM
 The funniest thing the funniest. Yes, absolutely. So the funniest thing. So I always tell the girls I'm and you know they have their I got them laptops for home school, they're a little Google Chromebooks, it's the same thing that all the schools use and they have their, you know, online homes going. But because they're Chromebooks, Google Chrome, they have access to all the Google tools. So like they have Gmail and they have Google Docs and everything.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:42 PM
 That was a cool trip.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:43 PM
 And I told them I said guys, you know, when you need something for school, don't just come in rushing, in my office, I might be on a phone call, but send me an email and this has been like, 3 years of getting them trained on like, if you need something from Dad during the workday, send an email and I'll make sure and check my email and respond. And so while we were on the while we were in Spain, I get this email and it's from Hazel's email address and I'm like okay well she needs something for school. No she got a Google doc, she got a project template for a project plan and she made a whole project plan out of the all-inclusive vacation that she wants to take because Mary and I were telling them about what an

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:43 PM
 Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:43 PM
 Inclusive is and what it means. Like, you can go eat food whenever you want. You can have as much drinks as you want. Like you don't have to pay for anything. It's all paid for upfront and so she's heard this. And now she's decided she really wants to go but she knows if she wants something to happen. She's got to send me an email saying. Not only did she send me an email but she prepared a project plan. Now keep in mind, she's 11 going on 12 and she got a project plan. She did the cost analysis. She said, I think it'll be 3 to 4 hundred dollars per night per person and this is how I think we should do it and these are the places we should go and I'm like all right game on my 11 year old can do like corporate level work better than most people can.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:43 PM
Wow.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:44 PM

 Yeah. Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:44 PM

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:49 PM
And it's it's fantastic because like I get soup a lot of times over there and la and I went into 1 little Pub first thing in the morning and we sit, you know, we knew it was lunchtime starting up soon and we said could we have a bowl of soup please?

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:50 PM
 And the guy goes into, what would you like? And I said a spoon to go with the soup. He goes, well, a spoon comes with a stick ma'am. I said I know, but you see, we're gonna split the soup because neither 1 of us, really need to eat that much. Yeah, because you're gonna split a bowl of soup. He goes, I'll bring an extra slice of bread for you because I always serve it with hot crusty roll, and it's lava butter. You know, I said, you can keep the butter, I just want the bread.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:50 PM
 Right.  We don't need 2. Yeah.  oh,  Oh yeah, yeah.  Yeah, right. You don't turn down that bread. I I learned that over in Spain. They they bred is everywhere and it's doesn't taste like it does here. I could do bread. If it was bred from over there,

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:50 PM
 And they have small loaves at the the grocery stores over in Scotland, you know? And it's like 30 cents 30 Pence, which is we just rounded up to twice the price. So 60 cents for a small loaf of bread. That's going to do me for 2 days. I'm fine with that, you know?

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:50 PM
 Yeah.  Right.  Yeah, that's hard to beat.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:50 PM
 Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:50 PM
 And it what they did it, they make it right there and I noticed a lot of times, I didn't go to many grocery stores, but a lot of the food that was available seemed to be made like right there. Like they made it in the restaurant or made it in the store. That's they're just part of their day is they're just going to make the bread that they sell that day.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:50 PM
 But yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:51 PM
 Yeah.  All the chippies, everything's fresh freshly battered. It's never Frozen. You know.  And I just get these we uh, we I told Jim. I said, we need to go to ASA and get started on our souvenir shopping. So we went to AA and I had a basket full and he goes I gotta go to the bathroom. I said, okay. And I had a basket full of stuff and he comes

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:51 PM
Making him nervous.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:51 PM
 No, he comes back with another basket attempt, he goes, okay, I'm ready to shop now. I was like, oh my God,

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:51 PM
 Yeah, you've got to got the second basket. That's so funny.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:51 PM
 I had 2 baskets when we left that store.  Well, he found he goes. Oh, I haven't had these for a long time. I said, no, because you keep telling me it's too expensive to buy them for you in town. So there are biscuits that he likes, you know, candy that he likes. Yeah, I had to kill, I don't know, the 3,000 dollars for extra baggage fees coming back this last trip.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:52 PM
 Yeah.  Right. Yeah.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:52 PM
 And remember when we mailed everything out that was 800 dollars for postage from Scotland. I mean it's worth it but we mailed everything because we could not bring it back. We had too much stuff. Well the true reason that we had the true reason we had to mail it back was every time I'd walk in he'd have somebody a souvenir open and I'd say that was for so and so I thought it was going to go bad so I had to eat it.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:52 PM
 Oh my God.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:52 PM
 Oh no.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:52 PM
 Oh yeah, the office.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:52 PM
 You had to get it out of Jim's hands.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:52 PM
 Because Jim kept eating the souvenirs, I'd have to go buy some more.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:52 PM

They docked me for whenever I'm driving because you, you know, you got to drive on the other side of the road and the steering wheels on the right side of the car and and Great Britain.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:53 PM
 Yeah.  Oh no.  Oh my gosh, that's like, um, it's like brushing your teeth with your left hand or your non-dominant hand.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:53 PM
 Yeah.  That's right, that's exactly right. I could not get used to it. Yeah, it's I love it. I think it's a blast C C drive good over there. You said real good driver. I may drive a little slower dog and I just begin with. I was driving 1 time he goes up, I think he might want to look down just pedometer. I'm going 120 miles an hour and people were passing me. We were on the highway coming back up from England because I I, I really think you need to, I said, oh s***.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:53 PM
 Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh my God.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:53 PM
 Oh yeah.  Oh my gosh. Oh no. Yeah. Oh my gosh. That's so fun. Well you guys now you guys get to have many more experiences like this and you know you know more alarm clocks unless you're getting on a plane to go somewhere fun.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:54 PM
 Yeah.  That's right.  That's right. Don't have to take vacation days or whatever we plan what vacation days we want. And we don't have to worry about getting back.  Yeah. I'm getting back in time and go back to work. Yeah. If there's a crisis happens and we get stuck there, that's fine.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:54 PM
 Yes, that too.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:54 PM
 That's always been a worry for me.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:54 PM
but also,  Well, I, I, I did want that and I, you know, Mary and I frequently, I mean, it took I don't want it to sound like, uh, I don't do any work because I do, but it took us about the first 10 years to get us to the point kind of financially where we could be at home, with our kids. Homeschool them be the ones that influence them, but then also we wanted to take them around and like show them the world and we will frequently go on vacation and be like, ah, we're not really done here. We don't feel like we saw enough. Should we just stay another week like so, you know, it doesn't have to be an emergency.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:54 PM
 Oh God. You know what?

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:55 PM
 Yeah, that and because you've got the RV.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:55 PM
 yes, that's also it helps that we have the RV because we can just see like

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:55 PM
 That's so great to have that choice you know, to have that option so to speak. Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:55 PM
 yeah.  5, 5 5 more days. Let's just let's just stay another week. There's we if we you know really it's Thursday and if we left tomorrow we'd miss out on the the festival that they're having on Friday and Saturday. So we might as well say at least until Friday and Saturday but then we don't want to check out Sunday because everybody's gonna check out Sunday. So we might as well push it to Monday and then we go gosh you know, but by then we're going to be pretty tired. We need at least 1 day of rest so we should leave on Tuesday.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:55 PM
 I love it.

(918) 605-3599 | Oct 1, 2025 06:55 PM
My way of thinking.

Andy Daniels | Oct 1, 2025 06:55 PM
 That's usually.

Our 35th Anniversary birthday, my 40th birthday and uh, we went over to tell my mom and dad and they already mom and knew that I was trying to get that because we know we figured out, we're going to. And then we go over and tell our family and they're going, we're going too. So there was all of us going, you know? And uh, that was my first time to go. Jim goes, I'll have to meet you over because I don't have enough vacation. I said, okay, so barbell and him were talking on the phone and he goes. So what do you think she goes? I don't need to see it all in these. This 6 weeks she goes, I'll be back. They had told me. They wanted to see it all while they were there because they were never going back.

And he goes on the front, it said it was 1199. I said, I know but on the back it said 99 p.  I said, and you couldn't see the back and that's why I was getting up, I go to the bars, which is a, it's a 100 year old flea market. It's now 105 years old.

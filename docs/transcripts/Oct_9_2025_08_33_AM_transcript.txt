Hey, Andy.  Andy.  Andy.

Andy Daniels | Oct 9, 2025 08:34 AM
Hey.

(316) 461-9133 | Oct 9, 2025 08:34 AM
 Hey, are you there?

Andy Daniels | Oct 9, 2025 08:34 AM
 Yes, can you hear me?

(316) 461-9133 | Oct 9, 2025 08:34 AM
 Oh yeah. Okay. So um, when I was talking to my guy yesterday, like um, you know, the guy from Spike from Morgan Stanley, he was like, he was like, oh, it's uh, I see, I thought the 40,000 was traditional, but it's cash. So the only thing I owe is the taxes on the capital gains, so I was like, oh my God, if I was gonna owe the taxes on 40, it was like I need to just roll it into something so, but um, but anyway, so I got it figured out.

Andy Daniels | Oct 9, 2025 08:34 AM
 Yeah.  Yes.  Oh, yes. No, that's true. We knew it was Cash. Um, and there's not really anything you can do about it to to move that or disposition that in a non-qualified, it just is what it is.

(316) 461-9133 | Oct 9, 2025 08:34 AM
 Does that uh, does that add to my income?

Andy Daniels | Oct 9, 2025 08:34 AM
 Yeah. I mean it with it will but in a different way because when it's capital gains, um it's not taxed at the same rate, so it should only be a 15% rate instead of a instead of a, you know, 30 or 33 or whatever it is, you're at,

(316) 461-9133 | Oct 9, 2025 08:34 AM
 This year.

(316) 461-9133 | Oct 9, 2025 08:35 AM
 Oh, okay, okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 9, 2025 08:35 AM
 So it's a minimum. It's a minimal impact.

(316) 461-9133 | Oct 9, 2025 08:35 AM
 Okay. Yeah, I think he said it's going to be like $100 or something like that. So,

Andy Daniels | Oct 9, 2025 08:35 AM
 Yeah. Are they gonna make you pay it? They're not gonna withhold that you just you can do that next April, right? Yeah.

(316) 461-9133 | Oct 9, 2025 08:35 AM
 No. Yeah, I'll do it. I'll do it next April, but does that 40,000 count as income?

Andy Daniels | Oct 9, 2025 08:35 AM
 Yeah. So  It will, yeah.

(316) 461-9133 | Oct 9, 2025 08:35 AM
 Oh s***. Does that put me over the next bracket?

Andy Daniels | Oct 9, 2025 08:35 AM
 but remember,  Because it's capital gains. So it's it it's like it's like a parallel process for calculating. Yes, it's technically income but it's not income. That's detected that 33 or 34% rate.

(316) 461-9133 | Oct 9, 2025 08:35 AM
 Right. But the capital gains is the income, not the 40, but the capital gains is the income. Not the 40,000.

Andy Daniels | Oct 9, 2025 08:35 AM
 It's, it gets a special.  Uh, correct. Yes.

(316) 461-9133 | Oct 9, 2025 08:35 AM
 if I take that 40,000 out in cash,  um, then I

Andy Daniels | Oct 9, 2025 08:35 AM
 Right? No, you have to subtract your basis. Yeah. Whatever you started with. So if it started with 30,000 and the gains is 10,000 right? Then you take out what you started with.

(316) 461-9133 | Oct 9, 2025 08:36 AM
 The gains will be the the 10,000 the 10,000 would be the uh would be the additional income.

Andy Daniels | Oct 9, 2025 08:36 AM
 Yeah.  Yes. But with a with an asterisk, because it's not income. Like the way your W2 money is income.

(316) 461-9133 | Oct 9, 2025 08:36 AM
 Okay.  No, it's capital gains. Okay, okay, got it. Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 9, 2025 08:36 AM
 So yes, it's it's Advantage so I don't I don't think it's a big deal.  For your whole.

(316) 461-9133 | Oct 9, 2025 08:36 AM
 Pardon.

Andy Daniels | Oct 9, 2025 08:36 AM
 April.  I said keep track of the stuff you buy for your home office and we'll figure it out in April.

(316) 461-9133 | Oct 9, 2025 08:36 AM
 Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah, I think they took that home office deduction away.

Andy Daniels | Oct 9, 2025 08:36 AM
Oh in the big beautiful bill? Yeah, yeah, well that's okay. I have some other ways around that

(316) 461-9133 | Oct 9, 2025 08:36 AM
 The big beautiful bill.  Yeah.  Okay, all right. Hey, we'll see you.

Andy Daniels | Oct 9, 2025 08:36 AM
 Just keep track of keep track of it. The way you used to write and we'll we'll get it. Sorted out.

(316) 461-9133 | Oct 9, 2025 08:36 AM
 Okay, exactly. Okay, we'll see you, bye.

Andy Daniels | Oct 9, 2025 08:36 AM

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:25 PM
Hello.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:26 PM
Hey, how you doing?

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:26 PM
 Hello good.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:26 PM
 Hey. Oh sorry, I think I meant to call Regina. You guys are both under the same entry in my phone.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:26 PM
 oh,

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:26 PM
 Uh, she was supposed to talk to me at 4.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:26 PM
 oh,  Oh, okay. She's standing right here beside me.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:26 PM
 I didn't, I didn't wake you up, did I?

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:26 PM
 Nope, not not at all.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:26 PM
 Okay, do you want to?  Do you want to use your? Do you want to use your phone or switch over to her phone?

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:26 PM
 She's standing here.  It doesn't matter. I'll let you talk to her. She's standing right beside me.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:26 PM
 Okay, cool.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:26 PM
 Hey, Annie here, I'll put you on speaker.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:26 PM
 Hi, sorry.  I called the wrong number.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:26 PM
 Fine, you're fine. How are you doing?

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:26 PM
 Yeah.  Good.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:26 PM
 Good, thank you for calling. I, I know you're small Mary said that you guys have a really cool opportunity down in. Um,  Witchita Falls or I'm sorry, a Valley Center.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:26 PM
 Oh um yeah. That's the I just

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:26 PM
 That that you've been working on stuff. Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:26 PM
 I just can't get away from them. Like, every time I'm like, nah, I'm done with them and they keep, it's like a carrot on a stick, but yeah. We're, we're getting a couple Amazon, uh, contracts with Amazon. So they're

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:27 PM
 pretty comprehensive and I would say yeah like

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:27 PM
 That's awesome.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:27 PM
 Really comprehensive. So okay.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:27 PM
 Yeah.  Well, very cool.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:27 PM
 Yeah.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:27 PM
 Very cool. Well, I I won't, I won't keep you on this, but we kind of just had a couple questions. Um, got us got a thing that, um, Dale's. Um,

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:27 PM
 Okay.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:27 PM
 the $50,000 policy Home Path policy is coming due in December and it said that if we wanted to do anything,

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:27 PM
 Uh, huh.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:27 PM
 Uh, renew it. Um  Uh liquidated or liquidated part of it that we had to not, let them know by 111, which I know that's still we can halfway 2 weeks away, but um, we had a question. So

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:27 PM
 Uh, huh.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:28 PM
 Cuz you know what?  Sooner rather than later, probably, we'll be looking at selling the house and we thought, well, if we have to, we can replace funds back into that.  At the sale of the house. So we don't want to put ourselves in in trouble on that but I I mean we won't, but you will have plenty from this. But uh, because we're thinking well, maybe what if we just use part of that and paid off a couple things that were uh, you know, we had so much last year. I I think I I told you that you know, with the credit cards were up.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:28 PM
 Yeah.  Uh, huh.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:28 PM
 Right.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:28 PM
 At 30 and we had and then we bought the truck.  Which was 33 something. So we had like almost 64,000 in debt. Well since then, um, we've paid off, um, over 20 on the truck, we only owe 14, something on the truck and we're down to um, about 11 something on, on credit cards. So we about 25,000, you know, from from 60 something. So that's good. But um,

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:29 PM
 Okay.  Yeah.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:29 PM
Anyway, um, if we were to liquidate even part of it, would it put us in a bad tax situation?

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:29 PM
Uh, well.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:29 PM
 How does that happen?

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:29 PM
 No. Okay, so a couple of things first off. Um,  First off.  Uh, the liquidation is not taxable because it's just the principle.  so, the taxes aren't really what we need to be concerned about but you know, that the right, the right thing to do the right way to

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:29 PM
 Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:29 PM
 really answer these questions for you guys is to make sure that you're analyzer is up to date. You need to look at how, um, we need to look at. Oh, you know what? All you guys have going on. What's the um,

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:29 PM
 You know.  As far as expenses what you guys are planning to do um if we get a good Baseline of where you're at now and then we we can kind of kind of um give that retirement analyzer a haircut. So to speak. I know it's been a minute since we've since we've you know since we've been into it. But really that's that's going to be the best way that I think I can say, here's what we should do. Um you know and I think it's a good way to do that because

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:30 PM
 Okay.  Okay, sure.  Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:30 PM
 It's not my opinion. It's not your opinion. We can see by the Numbers. Okay, well you guys could liquidate it but how much do you want to do the whole thing? Do you want to pay off all the credit cards? You know, that's certainly is an option. Um,

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:30 PM
 We need to look at, you know, what is your payment on the credit cards? Versus what are you getting from that home path?  How much how much you know how much is that costing you to hold those credit cards right? Um because I can see I can see a situation where let's see $50,000 is probably not it's going to be about 300 and 300 some dollars a month.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:30 PM
 M.  Wright.  We get 333 a month. Uh huh.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:30 PM
 Yeah.  What's the interest on all the debt that you're holding?

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:31 PM
 Well, you mean the different interest rates?

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:31 PM
 No, no, no. Not the rate, right? Um, I want to know how much. So the reason, the reason why people get so concerned about having debt

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:31 PM
 Is because it's not that they have to pay it back. If, if you guys took out $50,000 of debt and you just had to pay back 50,000, that would be less stressful than you taking out on credit cards, knowing that the interest is going to get charged, and you're going to end up being out of pocket 75,000, right? Right? That that's the stressful part about it.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:31 PM
 Right.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:31 PM
 If you took the fact that it's a credit card out right and I I don't want to not answer your question but I'm going to step up 1 level so we can kind of look at the bigger picture and then we can get down into the nitty-gritty on like okay what should we do? The bigger picture is

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:31 PM
 Right.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:31 PM
 Okay.  Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:31 PM
 If you had a savings account with fifty thousand dollars you went and spent it on all the things that you spent money on that caused that debt to rack up, but instead of the credit cards you had a savings account, right?

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:32 PM
 Mhm.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:32 PM
You wouldn't be stressed out that you hadn't paid yourself back into the savings account. You'd be like, oh we'll pay it back when we when we can pay it back and eventually we know we'll build back up to 50,000. That would be your psychology about that if it was just the savings account, right?

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:32 PM
All right.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:32 PM
 Mhm.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:32 PM
 but since it's credit cards,

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:32 PM
 Yeah, kind of but the oh, go ahead.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:32 PM
 yeah.  Since its credit cards, and there's an interest, charge to it in the back of your mind. I think most people are like this. We all know that somebody else is getting fat off of our payments, right?

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:32 PM
 Right, right? Which is why we take so much down. Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:32 PM
 So, and this is just  Right? And this is just kind of how I'm this is. Just kind of how I want to think about debt because there's a, there's a math component to it but then there's also a fear component to it. And what I don't want to do is I don't want to have us make decisions based on fear that then limit your options, as you figure out what you're going to do over the next couple of years. And I've seen this happen before it's happened, multiple times, I will explain this and somebody will go and say, well, I don't care. I want I want to alleviate the fear more and then inevitably,

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:33 PM
 Several months or years later, we took care of the fear, but now there's a cash flow need and they come back to me and they say, well, we need cash flow and I go, but you traded that for the fear that you didn't want to have remember, so that's okay. If we do that I think we just want to do it with a full like kind of upfront understanding. So what I'm trying to look at is I'm trying to say okay you guys have this $50,000 asset right now. That's the the note.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:33 PM
Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:33 PM
 And your question is, should we take summer all of that and pay off the debt?  And I'm thinking to myself, how much is the debt costing you? And is the payment from home path, effectively making that debt, that anxiety, that fear the reason for that, is it negating that? Because if it is, there might be some additional opportunities to keep the cash flow from home path and it, it's really irrelevant to me. What you do. I think we'll figure out, you know, mathematically what makes sense. And then you guys will look at it and go, okay? But emotionally, this is what we want. I'm okay with you guys, having a little bit of an override their sometimes. Most of the time people do things that mathematically.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:34 PM
 Don't make a lot of sense, but that's also because we're humans and we have to exist in the world that we create, right? So we need to have you guys have some peace of mind as well. So I'm just I'm, I'm not saying do 1 thing or the other. Just yet, I want to be really call attention to the fact that we have 2 different parallel processes. Going on. We have what is best for us mathematically, but that may not align entirely with what is best for us, mentally. Does that make sense?

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:35 PM
 And so that's why we need the numbers. That's why we need the numbers, right? Because this is this goes back to when we were kind of talking about the The Lakehouse and you know all things being equal. Would you rather have the debt paid off and just call it good? Or would you rather have the debt paid off and have $50,000 of assets, kicking off, $300 a month?

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:35 PM
Fine. The other. Um, Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:35 PM
 Yeah. Yeah.  Okay. Yeah, I can I get that. I I think the other is we're we're kind of hoping to alleviate  Um, we were thinking maybe alleviate any more debt.  or a payment, I should say a payment because, um,  I am seriously contemplating quitting it semester but then that's my other question is that if I were to quit at semester which would be like January 12th or so.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:36 PM
 Um, that's only 5 months into my contract and I would lose about 30,000 dollars.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:36 PM
What do you mean to lose?

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:36 PM
 I would not get paid of February through August. I get paid through August.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:36 PM
 Right.  Okay.  Alright. Alright. Alright. Okay, that makes sense.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:36 PM
 Yeah.  so I I would be just yeah, I would be at um,  Not quite my halfway mark, plus, I get additional benefits in retirement and everything else.  So but I just don't know how long I can go. I'm having a pretty tough school year.  and um,  Uh we were well so that with at least maybe 1 less payment or so it would maybe make us feel a little less.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:36 PM
 I wouldn't make me feel compelled to work through me. I guess I should say it that way.  Yeah, yeah. So

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:36 PM
 Okay.  okay, so that I mean and that

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:37 PM
 anyway yeah, I just kind of  And I know we got to decide by next Friday on this.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:37 PM
 I think that question.  Oh my gosh. Okay, yes. So we got it. We got some work to do. That's okay. Yeah. And so I really I want to encourage you that that question  I think until we have the numbers like kind of correct, right. And so here's what here's what that'll look like. I think I'll resend you the link to the analyzer so you can get in there and you can kind of update. Here's the important pieces that we need you to update the expense plan on table, number 3, kind of, where is all the money going out generally, right? And you know, it doesn't have to be exact but like for the most part where does the money go, how much is the mortgage? How much is the electric bill and all that stuff?

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:37 PM
 Right. Right.  Mhm.  Okay.  Mhm.  Mhm.  Mhm.  Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:37 PM
 Do that all by itself as it is right now and I think what will help you guys the most because there's there's probably going to be some transitions in, but we knew this was going to happen, right? When you guys bought that house, the whole goal was to build it live in it for a while and then be able to sell it and do the next thing. So that's okay that you guys are kind of ready for that stage but I think we should probably calculate our numbers based on what currently is not what could be. Um and by that I mean, you know going to sell the house. Okay. Well that's a huge like what if right you need to we need to make sure and get it on the market by like so right now or now let's just say take a snapshot of exactly what you guys spend every month and what it costs for you to be you right now as it is. And from there.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:38 PM
 Right. Yeah yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:38 PM
We'll copy that.  And I'll say okay, what if we take the 50,000 entirely and pay off the debt? How does that change things? What if we do this? What if we do that? Then we can start doing our what ifs but how things currently are.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:38 PM
 And then 1 of the big questions, we'll we'll ask is if you really do stop working in January.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:38 PM
 Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:38 PM
 Without the 30,000, you say well I'll lose 30,000, okay, but you guys are going to sell the house and, you know, that's going to make some money and we'll have some opportunity to either do some stuff back into home path, or whatever wherever you guys want to put it, we can store up additional income from there based on whenever it is that, that actually happens, if that makes sense. But right now, we just need the numbers on the current situation could you

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:39 PM
Right.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:39 PM
 Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:39 PM
 Stop in January knowing that we're not going to get the $30,000 from your income next year. What does that look like? How does that, you know? Unless I'll just do the projection is if you're not going to move then that will give you some kind of Baseline to start comparing Apples to Apples and

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:39 PM
 knowing that you guys can override the math for emotional reasons, right? If you just want to feel better, that you don't have debt, that's fine. Like we can make that work. I had a guy that wanted to pay off his house and we agreed, he wasn't going to. And then he did and his retirement income was down by 15,000 a year and he was really upset and I was like, but you decided to pay off your house. So now you don't have a house payment

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:39 PM
 Right. Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:40 PM
 Like that was the trade-off. You you traded the emotional piece for the math piece. I still think mathematically it all kind of worked out. He maybe had less money long term than he would have because eventually the mortgage would have paid off and he would have had the 15,000 a year but he didn't want to wait for that to happen. Which was an emotional decision, not a math decision.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:40 PM
 Right.  M.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:40 PM
 Yeah.  Mhm. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:40 PM
 And so it's okay to have both. I think we need to get the math straightened out. So let me do this. Are you okay with that? Does that kind of make sense?

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:40 PM
 Okay.  Yeah. Yep, absolutely absolutely. Now I just didn't want to wait until you know next, um, you know Friday because then it's that's it that's the deadline on the 31st. So I'm like okay you know, if so I figured I'd better. Plus I just been kind of weighing all this for a while and I don't want to do something stupid. I can grab my teeth and you know toughen up and finish the school year. But um we just you know we got a lot of other stuff happening and um and it's just like maybe maybe maybe getting rid of 1 of the bills would be helpful.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:40 PM
 Let's do this. I've  Right. Right.  Now, I understand.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:41 PM
 Right. Well, let's figure out.  Yeah, let's figure out the math piece of it. I'll, um, I'll go send you the login. I'll go, I'll resend you the login for that. Um, I don't know. I don't know where we're at. It's been a while since we updated it, but I will resend you the login. Just go into table number 3 and make sure that your expenses are generally close to where they're currently at. Um, I will make sure the assets if you want to look at table.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:41 PM
 Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay, yeah, no. I will.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:41 PM
If you want to look at table number 2, the assets Tab, and just make sure that is at least reasonably up-to-date. I'll come through. And, you know, make sure we have all the home paths that you guys have out there tracked and then,

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:41 PM
 um,

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:41 PM
 Okay.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:41 PM
 whatever your whatever your Social Security is on table. Number 1, make sure those numbers are correct too because I think since we put the VIN, you guys have had some some Pola increases probably and whatnot.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:42 PM
 Yeah, yeah. Okay. Sounds fair. All right, all right. I just thought figured, I better touch base with you.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:42 PM
 so,  Yeah, just click through it and then I will.  Yeah, no worries. And then as soon as you get that done, if you want to send me a text, I'll go through there and I'll start to organize the scenarios based on some of the questions that we do have anything. You actually stopped up there. What happens if we take the note, right? And I'll do a couple of combinations of things that may turn out that, we don't need that, you don't need to take the entire note. Like you said a partial liquidation, you might just take however much it is to to clear out the credit cards and then that gives you a clear clean Foundation to go on from there.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:42 PM
Okay.  Okay.  Okay.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:42 PM
 Mhm.  Yeah, yeah. I I I get that too. Also. Like like the truck is only a 5% interest rate, you know. So that's not so that's not so pressing it's like well okay but you know the credit cards are always like 17 and so um

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:42 PM
 Right. Yeah. Yeah.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:42 PM
 Uh, that that's the, that's the 1, that kind of bothers us. But um, anyway. Okay, okay, well, I'll watch for that to come through and

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:43 PM
 Yeah, let's look at the let's look at the map. Yep. Next thing is let's look at the map because I can't really say 1 way or another. What the best thing is

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:43 PM
 okay.  Okay.  so,  Yeah, no, I I understand, I understand. All right. Well, thanks, I appreciate it. And I bought oh, go ahead.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:43 PM
 Cool. Uh yeah, I'll I'll send it over right now.  Uh, your email RGN Harden, is that right?

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:43 PM
 Okay, and you had something else.  Yeah. Yeah.

Andy Daniels | Oct 19, 2025 04:43 PM
 Okay, I just want to check that. That was yeah, I want to make sure I had the right 1 email address.

(785) 307-1972 | Oct 19, 2025 04:43 PM
 Yep. Yep. At gmail.  Okay. Yeah.  Nope, that's good.

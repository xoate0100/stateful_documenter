Eight Keys to Bank On Yourself® 
for Maximum Lifetime Wealth and Financial Security
Courtesy of First Name Last Name, Bank On Yourself Professional


Following these Keys will help you get the most from your Bank On Yourself-type life insurance policies. They’re based on decades of experience helping clients manage and maximize the growth of their cash value in their policies. If you apply these Keys consistently, you’ll become far wealthier and happier over your lifetime than if you don’t.
Bank On Yourself Key #1:
A Bank On Yourself-type dividend-paying whole life insurance policy gets better every year – and there’s nothing you can do about it!
Here’s what I mean by “better.” The cash value of a dividend-paying whole life policy from a mutual life insurance company is guaranteed to increase every year. On top of that, the non-guaranteed dividends and the Paid-Up Additions Rider increase your death benefit every year. And that additional death benefit also creates guaranteed cash value increases every year. So, as you pay your premium for your base policy and the Paid-Up Additions Rider, you’re compounding the guaranteed increases in an exponential manner.[1]  
No other financial instrument offers a benefit like this.
Bank On Yourself Key #2:
There is no such thing as paying too much premium
If a Bank On Yourself-type policy is guaranteed to get better every year, then why wouldn’t you want to put as much into it as you can? You put money into a policy by paying premiums. All else being equal, the more money (premiums) you pay in, the faster your cash value will build. Think of your policy as a sort of savings account, only with far greater growth potential. Why put only $500 a month into such an account if you can afford to put in $1,000 (for example)? Why wouldn’t you keep adding to your life insurance portfolio as you find ways to pay more premium?
Then, when the time comes, I’ll help you plan your retirement income strategy properly so you can take the money out of your policies without owing any income tax on your withdrawals (under current tax law)!
Bank On Yourself Key #3:
Pay as much premium as you can for as long as you can
Prospective clients frequently ask, “How long do I have to pay premium?” That’s like asking, “How long do I have to keep saving money and watching it grow every year?”   
Don’t ask, “When can I stop?” Instead, ask, “How much can I pay in, and for how long can I keep paying?” 
If you take these first three Keys to heart, you will maximize your wealth accumulation over your lifetime.
Bank On Yourself Key #4:
Always use your own capital for making 
major purchases – borrow from your own “bank”
The idea of taking loans against your policy’s cash value is one we sometimes get pushback on. But it is so important. There are very few exceptions to this recommendation. 
This Key is embodied in the name Bank On Yourself. Is the concept called “Bank On Yourself, Unless Somebody Else Offers You a Lower Interest Rate”? 
Nope.
I’ll go deeper into this when I explain the next Key.
Another question I get is, “Why should I borrow against my policy if I can get a lower interest rate at a bank or credit union? If I pay less interest, won’t I save money?”
That’s an excellent question. Here’s the answer.
First, even if you’re offered 0% interest financing, you should still borrow against your policy – because there’s no such thing as a free lunch! Zero percent interest financing is a gimmick being dangled in front of you in lieu of a bigger discount. 
Always ask, “What’s the biggest discount you can give me if I pay cash?”
Here’s the second reason for borrowing against your policy instead of taking a lower interest rate: People often want to go for the lower rate because they mistakenly assume they can somehow enrich both themselves and the bankers. 
But you can’t. 
The interest you pay on borrowed money can only enrich those you pay the interest to. If you pay interest to others, you can only enrich them. 
And here is a key point: When you pay interest on your own policy loan, you’re enriching yourself. Why is this so? Because the interest you pay on a policy loan goes back into the same pool of money from which you are paid dividends.[2] Why would you want to build up the wealth of the bank when you could build greater wealth for yourself and your family instead?  
Any time you can cut out the payment of interest to others and direct that same interest to an entity that you own and control, you’ve improved your situation.
But, what about a home mortgage? Isn’t that something you should use outside financing for?
That’s an interesting question.
A home mortgage is a unique situation. There are good arguments both for and against financing a home (or paying down your mortgage as fast as possible), regardless of whether you use outside financing or your policy’s cash value.
Each situation is different, and I encourage you to discuss your specific situation with me so you can make an informed decision.
Bank On Yourself Key #5:
Never save your money in somebody else’s bank
We’ve all been told by our parents and by financial institutions to save money in the bank for a rainy day. 
And you may be thinking that if you have money in a savings account, you can use it to pay cash and you won’t have to pay any interest at all.
At first glance, that makes sense.
But if you think about it, you realize that if you have the cash to pay for a major purchase, you must be saving that money in somebody else’s bank, right? (Unless you’re in the habit of keeping tens of thousands of dollars under your mattress – which is a whole other problem!) 
And here’s something else you don’t want to overlook: If you save up for a major purchase in a savings account and then pull out your money to pay cash, the bank’s going to stop paying you interest. And you’ll only start earning interest again very slowly as you put money back in your savings account. 
If you borrow from your savings, you may not be paying interest, but you’re surely losing interest.
If you have your own capital – the cash value of your own Bank On Yourself-type policy – you should be using that capital to make major purchases. If you have money saved up in somebody else’s bank, use that money as additional premium for a Bank On Yourself-type policy because there’s no such thing as paying too much premium, and you want to pay as much premium as you can for as long as you can!
If you have a properly structured Bank On Yourself-type policy with a Paid-Up Additions Rider and there’s room to put more money into that rider, put the cash that you’ve saved up in somebody else’s bank into your own policy’s rider. A close up of a sign

And if you’re already stuffing as much cash into your policy as the policy permits, start another policy. But never save up money in somebody else’s bank!
Bank On Yourself Key #6:
Pay back your policy loans in a reasonable amount of time
Must you pay back your policy loans? Well, if you don’t, you are actually stealing from your own “bank.” 
So, you should pay your loans back in a “reasonable” period of time. What’s reasonable? It depends on what you borrowed the money for. 
If you borrow the funds to buy a new car, and you keep your cars for seven or ten years, then have your loan paid back within seven or ten years. (By the way, a bank or finance company would never offer you a 10-year car loan. But because you’re borrowing from your own “bank,” you can set any repayment schedule you feel is reasonable.)
If you borrow from your policy to take a nice vacation, plan to have the loan paid back before you expect to take your next vacation.
If you borrow the funds for a down payment on a new home, perhaps paying back your loan over 10-15 years is reasonable.
Remember, you are in control of your policy cash value and your policy loans. You can pay back your policy loans however and whenever you wish.[3]
Sometimes a client says they want to pay off their policy loan quickly. When I ask “Why?” they usually say they’ve been trained to not be in debt. 
But there are “good debts” and “bad debts.” Credit card debt is “bad” debt because you’re paying interest to someone else. A life insurance policy loan is “good” debt because the interest you pay ultimately benefits you – assuming you only take loans you can afford to repay in a reasonable amount of time. 
If you can’t afford something, you shouldn’t buy it – even using a policy loan. Wait to buy it until you can afford it. 
But assuming that it’s a sensible loan for a sensible purchase, and assuming you’re using your own capital to finance the purchase instead of somebody else’s capital, then pay the loan back in a reasonable amount of time. And …
Bank On Yourself Key #7:
Favor paying premium over paying back loans quickly
Remember, there is no such thing as paying too much premium. Premium that you pay can compound many times over your lifetime and can provide you with lifetime income.   
What is an “optimum” balance between your monthly premium payment and your monthly loan repayments? 
A good rule of thumb is: If you are paying more each month for loan repayments than premium, then you need to rebalance your cash flow plan toward paying premium by reducing your loan balance until you can pay more premium than loan payments.
I recommend that an optimum balance might be 50% of available cash flow to premium and no more than about 40% to regular monthly loan repayments. 
What about the other 10%? Think of that 10% as a cushion, a way to pay back loans that are taken for unplanned purchases such as emergencies or for big-ticket items like vehicles. 
Ideally, you would always have your own capital at work, which you’re borrowing to buy things that you need to buy. But try to keep your loan payments to no more than about 40% of your discretionary cash flow, so that you’re emphasizing paying premium rather than paying back loans quickly.
I need to mention that as you near the point in your life when you won’t be earning income – the time when you’re going to live off of your savings – you should get your policy loans paid back so that when you reach retirement, you have the maximum amount of cash value available to generate income for the rest of your life. 
As you near retirement age, the Keys get modified a little bit. But up until that point, you should be paying premium over paying back loans quickly.
Bank On Yourself Key #8:
When you Bank On Yourself, 
you can forget about loan interest rates and “rates of return”
Really? We’ve been taught that the rate of return on your capital is the Holy Grail of investing … and that you should do everything you can to get the lowest possible interest rate when you borrow money. Right?  
But when you’re using the Bank On Yourself strategy, there are sound reasons for not worrying about rates of return and loan interest rates.
When you Bank On Yourself, you have guaranteed growth, every year, for the rest of your life and beyond. Why “and beyond”? Because your death benefit is going to go to your loved one’s income tax-free, and presumably they’ll be putting that money into policies of their own – if you have properly explained the Bank On Yourself concept to them (with my help of course). In this way, there can be guaranteed growth forever. 
Not only that, but the growth rate in a properly designed Bank On Yourself-type policy is guaranteed to get better and better over the rest of your life, and there is nothing you can do about it! (See Key #1!) And the growth is exponential. 
What is the rate of return on guaranteed exponential growth? The growth of the cash value in a life insurance policy is not expressed as a “rate of return.” But the growth is guaranteed, and it is exponential. And if you’re like me, you’d prefer guaranteed exponential growth over some volatile, unpredictable potential growth (or loss) any day.
What about loan interest rates? Well, if you Bank On Yourself, higher interest rates are your friend because whole life dividends tend to track policy loan interest rates. And all dividends once credited to your policy are yours forever!
And because you are reinvesting your dividends and using them to purchase paid-up additional life insurance, those paid-up additions are going to work for you for the rest of your life, as well!

[1] Quick Review: a Bank On Yourself-type policy starts with a “base” policy. Then a Paid-Up Additions Rider is added. The Paid-Up Additions Rider is the most efficient way to build cash value because most of the premium for the rider goes directly to building cash value while purchasing only a small death benefit. Paid-Up Additions Riders are essentially small life insurance policies that require a one-time-only premium. The IRS limits the amount of premium you can pay into a policy’s Paid-Up Additions Rider.

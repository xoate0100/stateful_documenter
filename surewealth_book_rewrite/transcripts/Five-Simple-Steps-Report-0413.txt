Who the Heck is Pamela Yellen…  and What Makes Me Qualified to  Give You Financial Advice? 
I’m the author of the New York Times best-selling  book, Bank On Yourself: The Life-Changing Secret to  Growing and Protecting Your Financial Future. My  book has been endorsed by giants in the fields of  personal finance and business, including Mark Victor  Hanson (Chicken Soup for the Soul), T. Harv Eker  (Secrets of the Millionaire Mind), and Harvey Mackay  (Swim With the Sharks). 
“Bank On Yourself is a powerful and  
time-tested method that can guarantee your  financial security now and in the years to  come.” 
— Mark Victor Hansen,  
co-author, Chicken Soup for the Soul series  (more than 100 million copies sold) 
I’ve appeared as a source on every major TV and radio  network, including ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, Fox and  NPR, and my articles and interviews have appeared in  thousands of major publications and websites, including  Fortune Small Business, AARP, Time.com and the  Associated Press. (www.BankOnYourself.com/media coverage) 
I stumbled across Bank On Yourself almost by  accident. I’m not a financial advisor, but as a business building consultant who has worked with more than  
40,000 financial advisors since 1990, I’ve been exposed  to just about every financial product, tool, concept or  method for growing wealth. Frustrated by my own  experience following the conventional financial wisdom,  I ended up investigating over 450 financial products  and strategies, only to find most weren’t even worth the  paper they were printed on. 
Finally, one of my financial advisor clients told me  about this concept. I was intrigued. It almost sounded  too good to be true, but luckily I decided to keep an open  mind. Since then, the Bank On Yourself method has  enabled my family to: 
• Never miss a single beat while growing our  retirement fund – if it weren’t for Bank On  Yourself, we’d be in the same boat as so many  Americans, wondering if we’d ever be able to  retire and what we’d have to give up to do so 
(Studies show more than half of all boomers  aren’t expected to be able to maintain their  standard of living in retirement, and may not  have enough money to cover even basic living  expenses1) 
• Become our own source of financing and  recapture the interest we used to pay to banks  and finance companies (this method of paying  for major purchases is actually better than directly  paying cash for things – I’ll show you why in a  moment) 
• Have a financial safety net to see us through  some very challenging times. When my husband  landed in the hospital for emergency quadruple  bypass heart surgery, we got slammed with over  $15,000 in medical bills our health insurance  didn’t cover. We avoided the stress of putting it  on credit cards by simply borrowing it from our  Bank On Yourself plan and paying it back on our  own payment schedule 
• When my book was first published, I needed to  invest a considerable amount in my business to  upgrade it, but it was the peak of the credit crisis  and no banks were lending. No problem – I was  able to get my hands on a six-figure sum within  
days with no questions asked (while all my  business-owner colleagues were crying on my  shoulder about how their bankers wouldn’t even  take their calls) 
• Ensure our grandchildren will be able to go to  colleges of their choice – using the Bank On  Yourself method beats 529 Savings Plans,  UGMA and investment accounts for college  savings by a country mile (www.bankonyourself. com/college-savings)

Best of All, Bank On Yourself Has  Enabled Us to Stop Hoping We’ll  Reach Our Financial Goals and  Dreams and Start Knowing We Will! 
Once I knew from personal experience the  
extraordinary power of Bank On Yourself, I felt it  would be unfair to keep it to myself. And that’s why it  became my mission to educate Americans about this  and do my best to ensure no one ever again needlessly  suffers another lost decade in their financial plan…  or even a single lost day. 
However, I must warn you that Bank On Yourself is  not a magic pill. There is nothing you can put under your  pillow at night and wake up rich the next morning (other  than a winning lottery ticket). Anyone who claims such a  thing exists is a shameless huckster. The Bank On Yourself  method takes a little patience and discipline. But for those  who have those traits, it pays a lifetime of benefits. 
It can help almost anyone – regardless of age, income  or financial sophistication – reach their financial goals  and dreams without losing sleep. However, if you spend  more than you make, this is not for you. And if you’re  looking for a get-rich quick scheme, you will surely be  disappointed. 
Bank On Yourself may be able to help you if you have  credit card and other debt – as long as you’re determined  not to dig yourself in deeper, even if it means making  some changes to your lifestyle. 
In this Report, I’ll give you enough information to  decide whether Bank On Yourself is right for you or not,  and how to take the next step if you decide that it is. My  only request is that you keep an open mind – I promise I  can and will prove every statement and claim I make. 
“The problem in America isn’t what people don’t  know; the problem is what people think they know  that just ain’t so.” — Will Rogers
Have You Been Doing “All the  Right Things,” But Your Results  Have Been Disappointing? 
If you’ve been doing all the “right” things financially  that you’ve been taught to do, but have been disappointed  again and again, do you really believe that continuing  along the same path is going to suddenly start bringing you  different results? 
When You Bank On Yourself... You Can Know the Guaranteed Value of Your  Retirement Account on the Day You Want to Tap  Into It... And at Every Point Along the Way 
Because most people have followed the conventional  financial wisdom, they couldn’t tell you what their  retirement account will be worth on the day they plan to  tap into it if their life depended on it. Don’t kid yourself  – that’s NOT a plan; it’s gambling. 
We were taught we could ensure we’d have a  comfortable retirement by relying on the “three-legged  stool” of investing in the stock market, building equity  in our homes, and Social Security. Yet we’ve discovered  we can’t count on any of these legs, which have all  either collapsed or are in danger of doing so: 
• Wall Street lost more than 49% of the typical  investor’s money – TWICE – just since the year  2000! It could easily happen again in the next 5 to  10 years. Or even tomorrow. 
• The typical equity mutual fund investor has only  managed a 4.25% annual return for the past  20 years, which is only about half the return of  the S&P 500! Asset allocation and fixed income  investors have actually lost ground to inflation  for the past two decades, according to the well respected research firm, DALBAR2  
• The top-performing mutual fund of the last decade  had an 18% annual return… yet the average  investor in that fund actually LOST 11% per  year, according to the investment research firm  Morningstar, Inc.!3

How is that possible?!? 
According to the report, “shareholders often buy a  fund after it has had a strong run and sell as it hits bottom.”  It’s pretty hard to buy low and sell high if you buy high… 
Rarely a week goes by without another revelation of  fraud or an insider trading scandal on Wall Street.  But one thing never changes: Wall Street always gets paid – whether you win or lose 
•  Many Americans expected their home equity to be a  significant part of their retirement plan. In 2012, the  average home price had plunged to where it was in  2002, effectively wiping out a decade of equity, and  by the end of 2012, more than a fifth of all people with  mortgages owed more than their home is worth3 
•  Many people have jumped head first into things like  gold and silver, apparently unaware (or unconcerned)  that even after a meteoric rise in the price of gold, it  would have to be over $2,500 today, just to get even  with where it was 33 years ago in 1980, after adjusting  for inflation.  
•  The government keeps moving up the date (now 2033)  when Social Security will go bust6 
The good news is that the Bank On Yourself method  provides a solution to each of these challenges. 
“The highest form of ignorance is to reject  something you know nothing about.” 
— Dr. Wayne Dyer
So What is the Bank On Yourself  Method? 
Bank On Yourself uses a turbo-charged variation of  a financial asset that has increased in value during EVERY  single market crash and in EVERY period of economic  boom and bust for more than 160 years – dividend-paying  whole life insurance. 
But this is NOT the kind of whole life policy most  advisors and experts talk about! With this little-known  variation, you don’t have to die to “win.” And it can  beat the pants off your traditional saving or investing  strategies, as you’re about to discover… 
Policies structured the way I reveal in this Report  squash the arguments you may have heard that your  money in a whole life policy grows too slowly, or that the  agents’ commissions are too high. 
That’s because Bank On Yourself requires a dividend paying whole life policy with some features added on to  it that maybe one in 1,000 financial advisors or experts  knows about or fully understands. A large portion of your  premium goes into a rider that significantly super-charges  the growth of your money in the policy AND reduces the  commission the agent receives by 50-70%. 
The growth is both guaranteed and predictable.  But no two policies are alike, so to find out what your bottom-line numbers and results could be if you added  Bank On Yourself to your financial plan, and how much  income you could count on having in retirement, take the  next step and request a FREE no-obligation Analysis by  filling out and faxing or mailing in the Analysis Request  Form at the end of this Report.

Are you still skeptical? That’s not really surprising,  since you’ve probably heard people like Dave Ramsey,  Suze Orman and other financial “gurus” say that whole  life insurance is a lousy place to put your money. However,  a Bank On Yourself-type policy is a totally different “animal” that most financial advisors and experts don’t  even know about. 
FREE Personal Analysis and Recommendations – or turn to the last page 5 
Here’s a quick summary of the three key differences  between a Bank On Yourself-type policy and the ones  Suze, Dave and others talk about: 
 Key Difference #1: The policies they describe  usually have no “cash value” (equity you have access  to)for the first several years of the policy. However,  as I just noted, a Bank On Yourself-type policy  incorporates a special rider or option that super-charges  the growth of your money in the policy, especially in the  early years of the policy. As a result, you could have up  to 40 times more cash value than the whole life policies  Suze and Dave describe. This allows you to use the policy  as a powerful financial management tool right from Day  One.

Watch Suze Orman and Dave Ramsey  discuss Bank On Yourself! Our hidden  camera captured it all:  
www.BankOnYourself.com/hidden-camera
Key Difference #2: Unlike the policies most  experts describe, where your death benefit stays  level for the life of the policy, both your death  benefit and your cash value in a Bank On Yourself type policy grow at a steeper pace every year. Which  means the growth is at its peak at the time you need it  most – during your retirement years. (I’ll show you what  that growth curve looks like in a bit.) 
This gives you some built-in protection against  inflation, unlike a term insurance policy, which loses real value every year, due to inflation. And since your  premium stays level in a whole life policy, you’re paying  those premiums with ever-cheaper dollars. 
 Key Difference #3: Those who complain that,  when you die, the company “only” pays you the  death benefit and “keeps” your cash value have  apparently never seen a dividend-paying whole life  policy! 
On my website, I have a copy of one of my policy  statements that clearly shows that if I died on the date  of that policy statement, my family would have gotten a  check for an amount equal to the original death benefit  of the policy, PLUS the current cash value of the  policy… and then some! In fact, they’d get a total of  over $130,000 more than the original death benefit! 
To see this statement, along with additional proof,  check out my blog post, titled, “Suze Orman and Dave  Ramsey: Let’s Debate!” (www.BankOnYourself.com/ suze-dave) 
For the record, more than a few people have told me  they’ve alerted Suze Orman and Dave Ramsey about my  offer to publicly debate them and challenged them to do  so. Neither has taken me up on the offer, yet. Perhaps it’s  a case of “ignorance is bliss,” however, my offer stands. 
But Shouldn’t You Just Buy Term  Insurance and “Invest the Difference”? 
There are two basic types of life insurance – the kind  you rent and the kind you own. The most common type  is the kind you rent: term insurance. With this kind of  insurance, you have nothing to show for the money you  spent, unless you die during the policy term. Ninety nine percent of all term policies never even pay a claim,  according to a Penn State University study, and even the  experts agree that term insurance is designed to terminate  before you do! 
Other drawbacks of term insurance include: 
• No protection against inflation – if inflation  averages 4% per year, a 20-year term policy will  lose more than half its value! 
•If your health deteriorates before the end of the  term, you will have to pay more to renew it or you  may not qualify for coverage at any price 
In spite of these drawbacks, this is the kind of  insurance most financial experts recommend. The other basic type of life insurance policy is the kind you own – “permanent” or cash value life insurance. It’s the kind  many experts tell you to avoid.

Here’s what those same experts don’t tell you about  dividend-paying whole life insurance… 
Of course, that could be a good thing, given the  fact that Wall Street lost more than 49% of the typical  investor’s money – twice – since 2000.

You build up equity in the policy at a guaranteed  and predictable rate7 
You can use your equity in the plan however and

whenever you wish and for whatever you want 3 
You don’t have to apply or beg to use your  money in the policy, or fill out any nosy credit  applications, and you can’t be turned down for a  loan 
You can pay your loans back on your own

schedule, not someone else’s8 
5 
If an emergency arises or you get sick or lose your  job, you can reduce or skip some loan payments until  you get back on your feet.9 You won’t have any late  fees, or get harassed by collection calls. They won’t send a goon squad after you to repossess your stuff,  and you won’t get a black mark on your credit report. 
On the other hand, Bank On Yourself-type policy  owners have never had a losing year. Both your principal  and gains are locked in – they don’t vanish when stocks,  real estate and other investments crash. 
The chart below shows you the growth curve in a  properly designed Bank On Yourself policy. It gets better  every single year simply because you stick with it – no luck, skill or guesswork required:  
  

And what about “investing the difference” you save if  you buy term insurance instead of permanent? As much  lip service as has been given to that idea, I’ve never actually met anyone who bought a term policy, priced  the cost of a permanent policy, and then “put the  difference” into an investment account every month. 
  

This chart is based on one of my own Bank On  Yourself policies, showing the actual growth I’ve already  received in the policy, and the projected future growth,  based on the current dividend scale (dividends are not  guaranteed and are subject to change). 
You’re probably wondering how much premium  I’m paying into this plan every year. There are several  reasons I didn’t include that, and it’s NOT because I’m  trying to “hide” anything. 
The first reason is that you and I could each put the  identical premium each year into a Bank On Yourself type policy and each of our results would be different.  That’s because no two policies are alike. Yours would be

custom-tailored to help you reach as many of your short term and long-term goals and dreams as possible, in the  shortest time possible. Many other factors come into  play, as well. 
(To find out how Bank On Yourself can help you reach your goals and dreams – without losing sleep –  request a free Analysis at www.BankOnYourself.com/ request or use the Form at the end of this Report.) 
While your plan won’t look exactly like mine,  what will look similar is the growth curve. If you take  another look at that chart, you can see how it grows  more slowly in the early years, and then the growth  begins to steepen at an ever accelerating pace. 
Compare that with a graph of the whip-sawing  growth of the stock market, real estate or any other  traditional investment – which make a day on the  roller coasters at Great Adventure look tame. Those  investments can (and do) plunge just when you planned  to tap into it, dashing your dreams of a comfortable  retirement along with it. 
The second reason I didn’t include the premium I’m  paying into this policy is because I didn’t want you to  think that there’s a set or minimum amount you need  to put into one of these policies, or that you have to be  “rich” to do this. You can start at whatever level you’re  comfortable with.

Where Do You Find the Money to  Fund a Bank On Yourself Policy? 
If you’re like most people, you may not have  much money left at the end of the month and  may be wondering where on earth you’ll find the seed  money to fund a Bank On Yourself plan. Finding the  money is the third step and there are at least eight  common places to free up money 
(www.BankOnYourself.com/funding) to fund a plan,  and the Bank On Yourself Authorized Advisors (www.BankOnYourself.com/advisors) are masters at helping folks restructure their finances, often freeing  up dollars without impacting your lifestyle. 
Some of the most common places people find the  money include:

Tap your savings – your money could be working  much harder for you in a Bank On Yourself policy

A Tale of Two Very Different  “Bank On Yourselfers”… 
  
  
Rose Hillbrand Dan Proskauer 
Dan Proskauer and Rose Hillbrand came to Bank On  Yourself from dramatically different financial situations,  and their experiences point out the many ways people  use Bank On Yourself to reach their goals and dreams.  It also highlights how the desire to take back control of  your financial future is a far more important factor than  age, income, or level of financial sophistication. 
Rose knew the feeling of hopelessness that came with  the crushing debt she had incurred during and after  her college years. Her Bank On Yourself Authorized  Advisor showed her how to simultaneously eliminate her  debt while increasing her savings using the Bank On  Yourself method. 
Only a few years later, she had used her policies to  become debt free and to pay cash for the first time for  a car – a Scion. And she also had enough equity to self finance her dream vacation to Croatia!  
We videotaped Rose telling her inspiring story of  how Bank On Yourself helped her move to the other  side of the debt line to a standing-room-only crowd of  over 250 people when I was speaking in Ohio during  
a book tour. Check out Rose’s story here (www. BankOnYourself.com/rose-video)  
Dan Proskauer, on the other hand, is Vice President  of technology engineering for a major health care  company who holds three U.S. patents. Dan lives below  his means and has significant savings discipline. 
He’s a sophisticated investor, but when the financial  crisis hit, he realized he had nothing to show for  decades of saving and investing his hard-earned money  and “doing all the right things.” 
Dan is very analytical and has spent literally  hundreds of hours investigating Bank On Yourself. He  has since started nine Bank On Yourself-type policies  because, as he puts it, “The more I look at Bank On  Yourself, the better it looks.” As Dan notes, “The Bank  On Yourself method offers something you truly deserve,  but may not have – financial security and peace of mind.  With Bank On Yourself, you can sleep well knowing  your savings can only grow, never shrink. With Bank  On Yourself, you know, rather than hope.” 
This Picture is Worth a  
Thousand Words... 
  

Dan recently sent me the chart above showing how  his family’s net worth has grown since he started his  first Bank On Yourself plan 3 1/2 years earlier, and how  that compares to the previous 10 years. When he saw  this chart on his financial tracking software program,  
FREE Personal Analysis and Recommendations – or turn to the last page 9
Dan said his jaw dropped so hard it left a dent on his  keyboard and that “we should be shouting about this  from the rooftops.” 
Why would Dan be willing to reveal and discuss  something as personal as his net worth for the whole  world to see? Because, in Dan’s words... 
“If I can help a few people start Bank On Yourself this  year, instead of next year or instead of never, then it’s well  worth my time.” 
Dan noted that his income has increased some in  the last four years, as has the amount he saves each  year. The difference is that now he has a great place to  put that income (his Bank On Yourself plans), where  he no longer loses any of it to the “randomness of the  market”. And he’s convinced the picture you see above  wouldn’t look anywhere near this good if he hadn’t  discovered Bank On Yourself. 
One thing we consistently hear from folks who  have taken step 4, which is implementing the Bank On  Yourself wealth-building method, is how much more fun  and motivating saving money becomes when you don’t  have to worry about losing it or what effect the events of  the day in the U.S. or in some faraway place will have on  your hard-earned money! 
I encourage you to listen to or read my interview  with Dan Proskauer. (www.bankonyourself.com/dan shouting-about-boy) 
What Direction Do You Think Tax  Rates are Going Over the Long  Term? 
Many people like saving in 401(k)s and IRA’s  because they let you defer your taxes. But most  people I’ve surveyed believe tax rates can only go up,  due to continued government spending and aging  demographics of our country. Which means that if  you’re successful growing your nest-egg, you’ll only end  up paying higher taxes on a bigger number.  
However, under current tax laws, it’s possible to  take income from a Bank On Yourself-type policy with  
potentially no taxes due, through a combination of  dividend withdrawals and loans against your cash  value. (These policies are taxed more like a Roth type plan where you pay taxes before you make your  contribution. That avoids tax rate surprises later on.) 
What’s the impact of this? As an example, if you’re  lucky enough to retire in (only) a 33% tax bracket, your  401(k) or other tax-deferred retirement plan would have  to throw off about $104,000 a year before taxes to equal  what you could net from a Bank On Yourself plan that  throws off $70,000 a year. That’s an extra $34,000 every  year that you’ll need! 
What Day Do You Think the Dow  Will Hit 27,000?  
Does that seem like a crazy or dumb question? It’s  not. In fact, it may hold the key to your financial peace  of mind. Here’s why… 
What do you consider a minimum acceptable annual  return to make you willing to stomach the nerve wracking risk and volatility of investing in stocks and  mutual funds? 5%? 7%? Maybe even 10%? 
Does Warren Buffett Know  Something You Don’t? 
Warren Buffett, perhaps the most successful  investor of all time, noted in the Berkshire  Hathaway 2007 annual shareholder letter that,  during the 20th century, the Dow grew at 5.3%  annual compounded rate, and he doubts that  growth can be sustained for the next century.  What if Buffett is right? 
Most people I’ve talked to say they wouldn’t do it for  a 5% annual return. But if you were willing to accept  that, did you know that the Dow would have to be over  27,000 – TODAY – just to get you even with where you  were over 13 years ago?

Best Financial Move? 
When asked what his best financial move was,  Jeff Kosnett, a senior editor at Kiplinger wrote: 
“My wisest move was buying whole life  
insurance in the 1990s, precisely when  
countless books and articles mocked whole  life as obsolete. My wife, Debbie, did the same.  In the ten-plus years that we’ve paid $5,000 a  year combined into our policies, we’ve built  substantial five-figure cash values, can borrow  from them instantly at virtually no cost and  haven’t paid a cent of tax on the earnings.  Some might prefer putting the money into  certificates of deposit, but I can’t imagine a  better sleep-through-the-meltdown savings  asset than whole life.”10 
And if your minimum acceptable annual return is  7%, the Dow would have to be over 34,000 today to  provide you that, after adjusting for inflation. Don’t take  my word for it. This video reveals the facts. (www.bankonyourself.com/dow27k_video) 
So am I saying you shouldn’t invest at all in the stock  
You take an enormous risk investing in stocks, real  estate and other volatile investments until you’ve built  a solid financial foundation that can help you weather a  job loss, disability, medical emergency or anything else  life throws at you. Remember, it wasn’t raining when  Noah built the ark. 
To have the reassurance that a safety net can provide,  you’ll generally need to have an amount equal to one to  two years of your income in something that is safe and  liquid, so you can easily get your hands on it when the  proverbial you-know-what hits the fan. But who wants to  put that much money in a money market account or CD,  which are paying so little interest these days that you  need a magnifying glass to see it? What’s the alternative? 
A Better Place to Park Your Money 
Your money needs to “live” somewhere. That could  be a savings, checking or money market account or CD.  It could be an investment account inside or outside of a  retirement plan, real estate, precious metals, currency or  commodities. Or you could stuff it in your mattress. 
I know of no better place to store money that you  need safe and liquid than in a dividend-paying whole life  policy designed to maximize the power of the Bank On  Yourself concept from a top-rated company. Here are five  reasons why: 
market? No, I’m not saying that. But if you’re going  
1 
to do it, you should know the facts that Wall Street is  desperately hoping you don’t find out. And recent history  has shown why you should never put money you might  need within the next two decades at risk. 
Life’s a Lot Less Stressful When

You’re Working with a Financial  Safety Net 
Nearly half of all Americans say they definitely or

probably couldn’t come up with $2,000 to cover an  
unexpected expense in the next 30 days. And many  
say they’d have to rely on extreme measures to do so,  according to new research published by the Employee  Benefit Research Institute.11 
You could get substantially better growth than a  savings, money market account or CD, without  taking on more risk, so you’ll simultaneously be  
growing a retirement income you can both predict  and count on 
You’ll be able to get your hands on your equity  whenever you need it and for whatever you need it,  and you can pay it back on your own schedule, not  someone else’s8 
Unlike a 401(k) or investment account, you won’t  have any hidden or surprise fees and expenses.  With whole life insurance, you can know in  advance your bottom-line results AFTER all costs  have been deducted

You’ll have a death benefit that could be many  
4
times greater than your cash value that will provide  financial security and peace of mind for your loved  ones, or to leave to your church or temple or any of  many deserving charities and causes 
5 
If your policy is issued by one of the few  companies that offer this feature, when you  borrow your cash value in the policy, your policy  can continue growing as though you never  touched a dime of it (you’ll earn the exact same guaranteed annual cash value increase and the  same dividend12 you would if you didn’t use the  money in your plan)9 
Key Concept: If you want to get the maximum  growth from a Bank on Yourself policy, you should  pay back your policy loans (unless you’re taking  retirement income).9 If you borrow from a bank and  don’t pay it back, you’re stealing from the bank. If you  borrow from your policy and don’t pay it back, you’re  stealing from yourself. 
And while you do pay interest on your policy loans  (usually at below-market rates), that interest ultimately  benefits you as policy owner, just like all the interest  and investment income the company earns. I explain  how this works in detail in our Consumer’s Guide to  Bank On Yourself Policy Loans, which you can download  at www.BankOnYourself.com/consumer-guide. You  
You may be thinking, “That sounds too good to  be true. How is that possible?” Here’s how it works:  When you take a loan from a Bank on Yourself-type  policy, you’re actually borrowing against the cash value  of your policy and using the cash value and death  benefit as collateral for the loan. If you died with a loan  outstanding, they’d simply deduct it from your death  benefit. (And remember that your death benefit grows at  an exponential rate – just like your cash value – in these  policies.) 
You continue to receive the exact same guaranteed  annual cash value increase, regardless of any loans.  
In addition, any dividends you may receive are  calculated based on your policy’s death benefit, not the  cash value. A few companies will also credit you the  exact same dividend, whether or not you have a loan  against your policy. These are the companies the Bank  On Yourself Authorized Advisors recommend. This  feature allows you to use your money in the policy and  still have it working for you.

The equity in your policy can be used to take  advantage of opportunities and investments, as well as  to finance major purchases. Dr. West, a surgeon profiled  in Chapter 8 of my book, borrowed from his policy to  purchase shares in a surgical center where he does much  of his surgery, which provided him an excellent return on  investment. 
Dr. West described how it feels to cash in on this  remarkable feature of Bank On Yourself this way: “It’s  almost like you’ve been getting ripped off and now you’re  not any more. Knowing that your money truly is doing  double duty for you, it’s just the best of both worlds.” 
Why Financing Major Purchases  Through a Bank On Yourself Policy  Beats Directly Paying Cash 
The conventional ways of buying things are to finance  them, lease them, or pay cash. To illustrate this, let’s use  a car as an example: If you finance a car, all you have to  show for it is once the loan is paid off is your car, worth  a certain trade-in value. If you lease the car, you turn it  back in when the lease is up and now you have nothing at  all to show for your money. 
Some people figure they can beat the leasing and  financing rackets by paying cash for things. So they  start putting money aside in a savings account. Let’s say  you’ve saved up $30,000 to buy a car, and you pull that  
FREE Personal Analysis and Recommendations – or turn to the last page 12 
money out to pay cash for the car. How much interest are  you now earning on that $30,000? 
Zero! Nada! Zilch! 
Key Concept: All three of these scenarios are  losing propositions, because you either pay interest  when you finance things, or you lose the interest or  investment income you would have had if you kept the  money invested instead. However, if you save up your  money in a Bank On Yourself-type policy, you can then  borrow it to pay cash for your car – or anything else your  heart desires – and the money in your plan can continue  growing as though you never touched a dime of it.8 
How to Enjoy More of Life’s  Luxuries Without the Guilt 
As one happy Bank On Yourself policy owner described  it, “Instead of spending my saved up money and losing the  money by spending it, I will borrow from it myself (my  policy), and pay it back to myself, so I can use it again.” 
  

The Twelkemeiers on a guilt-free  
vacation in the Mexican Riviera 
Alan and Rachael Twelkemeier, who are profiled in  my best-selling book, first used the equity in their policy  to fund a much-needed vacation to the Mexican Riviera  
– the couple’s first true getaway since their honeymoon  eight years earlier. 
Noted Alan, “We couldn’t justify taking a vacation  all those years because we always felt like those funds  should be saved, and we hated the idea of financing it  on a charge card, and then having to pay all that interest  
and have the added stress of making payments for what  seems like forever. 
But now we don’t have any guilt about it because  we’re financing our vacation using our Bank On Yourself  plan, we’re paying it back to our plan over the next year,  and now we’ll be able to take a nice vacation every year  from now on. The key words are ‘no guilt,’ because Bank  On Yourself is a responsible way to do good things for  yourself that you normally wouldn’t do.” 
The Big Chill, Retirement  
and Rationalization 
Do you remember the scene from the 1983 movie  classic, “The Big Chill,” where the character played by  Jeff Goldblum asks, “Have you ever gone a week without  a rationalization?” 
Well, many boomers today are trying to rationalize  away the fact that they won’t be able to retire when and  how they had planned by trying to convince themselves  that retirement is overrated. They now talk about  continuing to work in some capacity as long as they can. 
While there’s no question that this can give you more  of a sense of purpose and fulfillment and keep you from  dying of boredom, the reality is that almost half of  retirees say they were forced out of work earlier than  they’d planned because of layoffs, poor health or the  need to take care of a loved one, according to EBRI.11 
I love what I do, and I hope to be doing it for a long  time. But shouldn’t the decision to retire – or not –  be a matter of choice, not necessity? 
The Shocking Truth About  
401(k)’s… 
Few people know that a law was passed a few years  ago giving employers protection from liability if they  automatically put your 401(k) contributions into certain  types of mutual funds – even if you have disastrous  results. You could fall far short of your retirement goals  and have no recourse! 
FREE Personal Analysis and Recommendations – or turn to the last page 13
As a result of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, more and more employers  are making these types of mutual funds the “default” investment, and many move  employees’ money into those funds, even if they’d previously chosen a different  fund. 
The investments the Department of Labor deemed “suitable” have been proven  to be very costly, risky and unpredictable. A recent survey showed that 58% of  the people who own these mutual funds that the government and employers are  shoving down people’s throats don’t have a clue how they work or how risky they  are.13 
Astonishingly, the vast majority of 401(k) participants let their plan  administrators decide where to invest their money.13 
After conducting a year-long investigation into 401(k)’s with a Pulitzer Prize nominated investigative journalist, we published a stunning exposé (www. BankOnYourself.com/zombie-investors). If you’re investing in a 401(k), I strongly  urge you to read it. A few of the shocking and fully documented facts our research  revealed include: 
• Even paying total fees and expenses of only 1.5% can wipe out 39% of your  retirement nest egg – on average, participants in small plans pay 1.9% in  fees annually and participants in large plans pay 1.08% per year14 
• There is a tax-time bomb hidden in your 401(k), because one of its big  appeals is that it lets you defer you taxes. But, as I mentioned earlier, if tax  rates go up over the long term, as seems likely, and you’re successful in  growing your account, you’re only going to pay higher taxes on a bigger  number! 
The 401(k) Disaster:  
The reality is that when you factor in fees, inflation and deferred taxes  you’ll owe, your 401(k) will probably have to deliver an average annual  return of 8% to 10% - just to break even with what you paid into it.13 
Some people say they keep putting money into their 401(k) to get the employer  match. But even the match doesn’t come close to making up for the money you lose  to fees. And if you can lose 49% or more of your savings in a market crash – as many  people did in 2000 and again in 2008 – a 3% match is little consolation. 
And don’t be suckered into believing the money in your 401(k) or IRA  is “yours” – the government controls your money in the plan, setting rules,  restrictions and penalties they can change at will about how much you can  withdraw or borrow and when. 
But the biggest reason I’m not a fan of these plans is that they encourage people  to rely on the “hope and pray” method of reaching their savings goals, rather than  on guarantees and predictability. 
  

“I have been an estate,  business and charitable  planning attorney for over  40 years. Bank On Yourself  is a very avant garde  
technique that we and select  life insurance professionals  have used for some time.  The idea of turning a life  insurance policy into a  more flexible Roth IRA  substitute is a real winner.  The technique also enables  setting up asset protection,  stand-by emergency money  and tax savings.”

Does Your Age or Health Matter? 
Many people in their 60’s start Bank On Yourself  policies, and special programs exist for folks up to age 85.  After all, with people living longer, wouldn’t you rather  plan on having your money last until you’re 90 or 100  years young, rather than risk having your money run  out before you do? For more detail on how Bank On  Yourself for people between 60 and 85 works, go to www. BankOnYourself.com/boy-for-seniors-sr 
And don’t rule yourself out because of your age or health  problems, because you don’t have to be the insured on  the policy. What’s important is that you own and control  the policy – someone else can be the insured, typically a  spouse, child, grandchild, parent or business partner. 
How Much Does it Cost to Start  a Bank On Yourself Policy? 
There’s no set amount you need to put into the  plan – each plan is custom tailored and you can begin at  whatever level is comfortable for you. 
Bank On Yourself Advisors don’t charge a fee to  review your situation and design your policy. If you  decide to implement the policy they design for you, they  receive a commission from the insurance company, which  has already been taken into account in the bottom-line  numbers and results you will see when you take advantage  of a free Analysis. And remember – when a Bank On  Yourself Authorized Advisor structures your policy this  way, their commission is reduced by 50-70%.

Is There a Different Financial  Product or Vehicle that Can Do  What Bank On Yourself Can? 
I think by now we all realize there are no magic pills.  Today’s “hot” investment is almost always tomorrow’s  loser, whether it be stocks, real estate, gold, currency or  ostriches. Falling victim to the “this time is different,”  “I’ll know when to sell,” or “this investment can’t go  down” mentality is a sure path to financial insecurity. 
Of the hundreds of financial products and vehicles  I’ve investigated over the past two decades, none have  come close to providing the flexibility, advantages and  guarantees of Bank On Yourself. 
If you’re still skeptical, I encourage you to take the  $100,000 Challenge: I’ve had a standing offer for over  four years to pay $100,000 cash to the first person who  can show they use a different product or strategy that  can match or beat Bank On Yourself. If there is a better  strategy, I want to know about it, so I can use it for my  own family and share it with others. You can take the  challenge at www.BankOnYourself.com/$100k.

So Where Do You Find Expert  Help? A Word of Caution… 
When you’re ready to get started, how do you find  someone qualified to design and implement your Bank  On Yourself policy? You may be tempted to discuss this  with your financial advisor or insurance agent, and ask  him or her to help you implement this program.  
However, if your policy isn’t structured correctly, or  the wrong product is used, your policy could grow much more slowly, or it could lose the tax advantages, or both.  Out of more than 1,500 major life insurance companies,  only a handful even offer policies that have all the features  required to maximize the power of the Bank On Yourself  method.16 
Unfortunately, most advisors “don’t know what they  don’t know” and, in my experience, a little knowledge can  be a dangerous thing. I found this out the hard way when  
an advisor structured my first policy incorrectly, causing  it to lose its tax advantages.  
My sister worked with an advisor who swore up and  down he knew how to properly implement this strategy.  We only found out years later that he had structured it  wrong, so it’s growing much more slowly than it could  have. As a result, she’s had to postpone her retirement  plans for many years. 
And if your financial advisor tells you he already  understands all the important details necessary to help  you implement and benefit from Bank On Yourself, you  may want to ask him, “If you could have done this for me,  why didn’t you?” 
Important: Beware of any advisor who tries to sell  you a different type of life insurance policy, like indexed  universal or variable life. No other type of life insurance  
policy comes with as many guarantees as whole life.  And no other type of policy is appropriate for the Bank  On Yourself concept. 
The unfortunate and costly experiences my sister and I  had, along with requests from folks all over the country for a  referral to an Advisor who truly understands all the ins and  outs of the Bank On Yourself method and could act  
as their professional guide, led to the creation of the  Bank On Yourself Authorized Advisor Training Program (www.BankOnYourself.com/advisors). Today, there are  some 200 advisors across the country that form the core of  Bank On Yourself Authorized Advisors. 
The Bank On Yourself Advisor  Training Program Includes… 
• Rigorous, advanced training on policy design and  the technical aspects that make these policies such a  powerful financial tool 
• Advisors must pass a certification test and take  continuing education classes 
• The advisors work under the guidance of technical  and policy-design experts who have each designed  thousands of Bank On Yourself-type policies

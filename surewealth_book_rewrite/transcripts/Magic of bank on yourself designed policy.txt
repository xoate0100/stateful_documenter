The Magic of Good Bank On Yourself Plan Design 
You probably know by now that the Bank On Yourself method relies on a specially-designed dividend-paying whole life insurance  policy, issued by a company that is financially very strong and has an unblemished track record of paying dividends for 100 years or  more. But you may be wondering about those mysterious riders (or options) that are added, which grow your cash value significantly  faster than the whole life policies most financial experts talk about.   
With these riders in place, you’ll have equity (“cash value”) in your policy in the very first  
month. And you can potentially use that equity as a powerful financial management tool  
right from the start. (For the record, the policies that Suze Orman, Dave Ramsey, and most  
other experts describe do not pay dividends and typically have no cash value at all in the  
first year.) 
So let’s take a peek under the hood and see exactly what those riders are and how they  
make your cash value grow so much faster. 
A key goal of the Bank On Yourself strategy is to maximize the growth of your cash value 
without increasing your premium. The cash value is the storehouse of money you’ll use to  
bypass banks, credit card and finance companies to become your own source of financing.  
Use that money wisely, and you might eventually be able to finance most or all of your  
lifestyle from it! 
Here are the step-by-step results of: 
  
Starting with a base policy 
  
Adding a Paid-Up Additions Rider (PUAR) 
  
Adding a Term Rider 
How Your Premium Is Allocated Is the Key to Growing Your Cash Value 
Table A below compares three different dividend-paying whole life insurance policies, all created for the same 35-year-old man. The  annual premium in each policy is set at $12,000, but how the premium is being allocated varies. (Don’t get hung up on this specific  premium or starting age. This is just an example. Your policy is custom tailored to your personal situation, so you can start at  whatever level works for you. Plans can be efficiently designed for newborns through age 85.)

Policy 1: All Base 
Policy 1 is a traditional dividend-paying whole life insurance policy for a healthy 35-year-old we’ve called Martin for no particular  reason. All of Martin’s premium is allocated to the base policy, and no riders are added. A policy that’s all base has a larger death  benefit to start, but that comes at the expense of the growth of the cash value. 
See the circled amount on the line for Policy Year 7? This is significant because beginning in this year, the annual cash value  increase is more than the premium Martin pays each year. (His $12,405 cash value increase is greater than his $12,000 premium.)  This makes Martin a happy camper. 
Policy 2: Base + Paid-Up Additions Rider 
In Policy 2, only 40% of each year’s premium goes into building the base policy. The remainder purchases Paid-Up Additions. Paid Up Additions are the most efficient way to build cash value because they channel most of the premium directly into the cash value  portion of the policy, while purchasing a small death benefit. A Paid Up Addition is like a mini-life insurance policy that requires a one time-only premium. 
See the circled amount on the line for Policy Year 5? With much of the premium purchasing Paid-Up Additions, the annual cash value  increase begins exceeding the annual premium two years earlier than in Policy 1. (The $12,572 cash value increase is greater than  the $12,000 premium.) Woohoo! 
Well over 90% of every Paid-Up Additions Rider premium dollar goes directly to building cash value, very little goes to the cost of the  death benefit, and only a minuscule amount goes to the advisor as a commission. An advisor who wants to help you build your cash  value by adding a significant Paid-Up Additions Rider must be willing to take a huge cut in commissions. Learn how to find a Bank On  Yourself Authorized Advisor who knows how to structure these policies properly and is willing to give up much of his or her  commission. 
Note:  The premium you pay into your Paid-Up Additions Rider is an optional premium.  You don’t need to pay it to keep the policy in  force.  So in a pinch, you can cut back on it, and some companies will even let you catch up on some or all of it later, as your situation  allows. That gives you greater flexibility than a traditional no-frills whole life policy has. 
Policy 3: Base + Paid-Up Additions Rider + Term Rider 
In Policy 3, only 30% of Martin’s premium is used to pay for the base policy. The remainder purchases Paid-Up Additions and a term  insurance rider. 
Why add a term rider to a whole life policy? Hasn’t Bank On Yourself been saying term insurance is  
a bad idea? As a substitute for permanent life insurance, generally yes. But term coverage has a  valuable place as a rider to a permanent policy. Here, the term rider allows you to pay more into  your PUAR, and thus build cash value faster, without running afoul of the modified endowment  contract (MEC) guidelines. 
Because the term rider increases the death benefit, the IRS formula allows Martin to plow more  money into his cash value without turning the policy into a MEC. The term rider is designed so that  it can be jettisoned sometime between the end of the seventh and the twentieth policy years. (The  first seven years of a policy are the most critical years in determining whether or not a policy will  become a MEC.) 
WHAT’S A MODIFIED  ENDOWMENT  
CONTRACT, OR MEC? 
The IRS places a limit  on the percentage of  premium that can be  
channeled into the  cash value of a life  insurance policy –  without jeopardizing  
its tax benefits. If the

Note: It’s important to understand that it’s not always possible to structure a policy so that only 30  percent goes toward the base policy. 
Every policy is different based on many variables such as age, need for insurance, how soon you  plan to take retirement income, etc.  But when you with with a Bank On Yourself Authorized  Advisor, they will structure your policy to direct the lowest percentage of premium to your base  policy that will let you achieve the goals you set for your plan – without turning the policy into a  MEC. 
Getting back to Policy 3, you’ll notice several interesting items. First, look at the circled amounts on  the line for Policy Year 1. At the end of the very first year, Policy 3 has almost eight times more  cash value than in Policy 1 (the policy with no riders at all). A properly applied Paid-Up Additions  Rider and term rider provide that powerful super-charging effect. 
Now check out the circled amount on the line for Year 4. The PUAR and the term riders have  caused Martin’s annual cash value increase to exceed his annual premium beginning in the fourth  year – one year earlier than Policy 2, and three years earlier than Policy 1. (His $12,337 cash value  increase is greater than his $12,000 premium.) Go, Martin! 
policy exceeds this  limit, it becomes a  MEC and loses a key  tax advantage. The  limit is based on a  complicated formula  that compares the  cash value to the  death benefit. The  higher the death  benefit, the more  money can be  
channeled into the  cash value. 
Your reward for patience in the early years of your policy is a growth curve that gets steeper every year you keep the policy. Even the  supercharged policies used for the Bank On Yourself concept grow more slowly in the early years.  It takes a while for your cash value  to equal the premiums you paid, though from day one, your premiums are immediately providing you with the full death benefit of your  policy and the peace of mind this brings. 
Go back to the chart and look at the line for Year 20 in Policy 3. Beginning this year, Martin’s cash value increases by more than twice  the amount of premium he pays ($26,077 cash value increase, compared to $12,000 premium paid). And beginning in year 30, his cash value increases by more than three times his premium ($37,994 cash value increase, compared to $12,000 premium paid.)  Martin’s doing his happy dance now! 
Zero premium paid, but cash value grows by over $59,000 
Even more exciting: Look at the line for Year 40. That’s the last year Martin is scheduled to pay any premium at all, and the policy  keeps on growing, but without any premium payments. See the line for Policy Year 50? The premium paid was zero, but the cash  value grew by $59,425 – no luck, skill or guesswork required. 
One more thing to keep in mind – it’s possible to have even more cash value than shown in this chart, depending on how you use your  policy for financing major purchases. That’s another reason it’s important to work with a Bank On Yourself Authorized Advisor who  can show you ways to maximize the value of your plan. 
Each policy is custom tailored – there are no cookie-cutter plans – so your plan won’t    
look like Martin’s. However, you can find out what a plan designed for your unique

More Cash Value Plus More Death Benefit? 
But what about the death benefits of these policies? Are these policies building up much death benefit? That’s a good question, and  Table B below shows you the answer. As you see in that table, all three policies build significant death benefits over time. But  ultimately, Policy 3 actually builds the largest death benefit of them all. (FYI – the policies Suze, Dave and others talk about have a  level death benefit that never increases.) Let’s take a look: 
Death Benefit Growth*

Let’s compare the death benefits in Year 1. In the early years of Policy 1, the cash value was relatively small while the death benefit was  relatively large, right? In the first year, the death benefit in Policy 3 is a little more than half of the death benefit in Policy 1. For Martin,  this is a good thing, because the growth of his cash value is very important to him. He’s paying for roughly half the death benefit, but  he’s building almost eight times more cash value, with all the financing power, control, and tax advantages that a Bank On Yourself type life insurance policy offers him. 
Something significant happens in Policy 3 in Year 7. In this particular example, the death benefit drops from $580,440 to $506,010 the  following year. Huh? This happens because the term rider is jettisoned. But now Martin’s policy is positioned for maximum cash value  growth and the death benefit in Policy 3 is growing even faster than in either Policy 1 or Policy 2. In fact, by Year 24, Martin’s death  benefit in Policy 3 exceeds what he would have had in either Policy 1 or Policy 2. 
In Year 40 in each of these policies, Martin’s premiums will stop, because the policies were designed to be fully paid up at age 75.  However, both his death benefit and his cash value will continue to grow each year. By Policy Year 50, the death benefit in Policy 3  tops $2,000,000, even though he didn’t pay any more premiums after Year 40. If Martin passes away at age 75, Policy 3 could allow  him to leave a legacy of $1,646,123 for his family or favorite charities. And that gift can pass income tax-free under current tax law,  and without going through probate. 
Should he live until 85, Martin’s legacy can grow to more than $2 million, and should he live to 95, it could grow to more than $2.5  million. 
Like Martin, you can enjoy a wealth-building and retirement income strategy that comes with guaranteed, predictable growth,  safety, tax advantages, and more. It’s a step-by-step process that’s outlined here.

The Great "Rate of Return" Hoax *John, when is 3.44% better than 7.28%?* 

| Many people believe that putting their money  at risk in tax-deferred plans such as IRAs and  403(b), 401(k), and 457(b) plans is the only  way to minimize taxes, outpace inflation and  provide them with enough income to maintain  their lifestyle in retirement. But is this really  true?  Here is a comparison of the projected growth  of a Bank On Yourself-type life insurance  policy custom-tailored for you, vs. the  projected growth of a hypothetical tax deferred account over 30 years. It shows the  approximate rate of return such an account  would need to achieve, in order to provide the  benefits that could be built in to your Bank On  Yourself policy. |

CASH VALUE: Based on your projected premium payments and withdrawals, and using the  current dividend scale (which is subject to change), in 30 years your cash value could reach: 

EQUIVALENT RETURN: To accumulate that sum in a traditional retirement account based on  the same deposits and withdrawals, the retirement account must earn: 

LIFE INSURANCE: To also provide an equivalent death benefit in a term life policy with a $950  annual premium, the retirement account must earn: 

FEES/COMMISSIONS: To also cover fees/commissions totalling 2% (fees and commissions are already  factored into the bottom line numbers you see in your policy), the retirement account must earn: 

INCOME TAX: Your policy's values may be accessed with no taxes due, under current law. To cover the  taxes due on a tax-deferred retirement account, at a combined tax rate of 35%, the account must earn: 

LONG TERM CARE: To also cover the $563 annual premium for a basic long term care benefit (long term  care is already included as a benefit in your Bank On Yourself policy), the account must earn:

**Reality Check, Additional Information and Notes REALITY CHECK** 

**1**   
**Long-Term Market Underperformance:** For the 13 year period ending December 31, 2012, the S\&P 500 total return (including  dividends) averaged only 1.7% per year, which lagged inflation. 

**2**   
**The typical investor underperforms the stock market indexes by a wide margin:** In fact, for the last **two decades**, the typical  equity fund investor only beat inflation by less than 1% per year, and got **less than half** of the return of the S\&P 500\. (Source:  DALBAR 2012 Quantitative Analysis of Investor Behavior) 

**Retirement Account Fees:** Even after new rules went into effect in 2012 requiring 401(k) plans to improve fee disclosures, most    
**3** 

participants still don’t know the total fees they pay. Fees may be as low as 0.2% per year in the largest plans, and as high as 5% in  the smallest plans. (Source: BrightScope) If your plan has fewer than 1,000 participants, you are likely to be paying ***at least*** 1% in  fees. (Source: Deloitte Consulting) 

An increase in fees of only 1% can wipe out 28% of your retirement savings over the next 35 years, according to the U.S.  Department of Labor. Contrast that with a Bank On Yourself-type policy where all fees and commissions are **already** included in  the bottom line numbers you see in your policy.

**ADDITIONAL INFORMATION** 

Long Term Care: The rate quoted is the approximate annual premium for a policy with a $2,000 monthly benefit, a three year  benefit period, no cost of living adjustments, and a 90-day elimination period. Coverage with more generous benefits would, of  course, push the cost, and the required interest rate, higher. 

On the other hand, Bank On Yourself-type policies include a long term care benefit equal to 2% of the initial face amount of the life  policy, up to $8,700 per month for stays in a long-term care facility or for home health care. See the policy rider for a full description  of terms. This is not an offer to sell, nor a solicitation to purchase, long term care insurance.

Notes on *The Great “Rate of Return” Hoax* report:  

The two-page report is highly customized by you. You provide the following information to  complete the report:  

A. Your name and information    
B. Prospect’s name    
C. Prospect’s age, for LTC premium calculations, or “NA,” if no LTC benefits are being  proposed in the BOY policy  

D. The annual premium of a 30-year Term Life policy, with a death benefit equal to the  first-year death benefit of the BOY policy you are proposing  

E. The annual fees/commissions your client is presently paying (we suggest 2%, unless  you know the prospect is in a no-fee strategy, such as money market funds or CDs  F. The tax treatment of the prospect’s present investment: Deferred (such as IRA),  Exempt (such as Roth), Taxable (such as most savings accounts and CDs)  G. The prospect’s combined state and federal tax bracket (from their latest tax returns)  H. Whether the client’s money is presently safe or at risk. (If the account is market based, the answer is probably At Risk. If it's a safe-money account, the answer is  probably Safe.)  

I. A personal message from you to the client, if desired    
J. The annual premium payments, partial withdrawals, non-guaranteed net cash values,  and non-guaranteed death benefits (cut and pasted directly from the client’s BOY  illustration)  

With that information from you, the report is customized as follows (Refer to the blue numbers  in red circles on the report):  

**Page 1** 

1\. The client’s first name is entered here. However, if the client’s money is currently  SAFE, this entire line is omitted. This line becomes irrelevant, if the client is  presently earning only 1% or 2%.  

2\. These two paragraphs change, depending on the type of strategy the client is presently  using. When you answer the tax treatment and risk questions, we automatically insert  the proper paragraphs, based on one of these six possible combinations:  

a. Deferred/At Risk (such as market-based IRAs)    
b. Deferred/Safe (such as CD-based IRAs)    
c. Exempt/At Risk (such as market-based Roth IRAs)    
d. Exempt/Safe (such as CD-based Roth IRAs)    
e. Taxable/At Risk (such as non-qualified brokerage accounts)    
f. Taxable/Safe (such as non-qualified savings accounts and money market  accounts)  

3\. The chart reflects the values you inserted from the illustration  

4\. CASH VALUE amount is taken from the illustration  

5\. EQUIVALENT RETURN is the calculated internal rate of return of the BOY life  policy 

1    
6\. LIFE INSURANCE percentage is the internal rate of return of the BOY policy PLUS  the annual premium you specified for an equivalent term life policy  

7\. FEES/COMMISSIONS percentage is based on the calculation in \#6, expanded to  include an annual amount equal to the fee percentage you specified. If the prospect is  currently in a no-fee product, the verbiage changes to reflect that, and the percentage  amount is unchanged from \#6.  

8\. INCOME TAX percentage is based on one of the three following scenarios, as  specified by you.:  

a. Tax Deferred: To the calculation in \#7, we add a return sufficient to provide tax at  the combined rate, on all funds, since all withdrawals will eventually be taxed.  b. Taxable: To the calculation in \#7, we add a return sufficient to provide tax at the  combined rate, on all withdrawals that exceed premiums paid, since premiums  were paid with after-tax dollars.  

c. Tax Exempt: If the prospect is currently in a tax-exempt product, the verbiage  changes to reflect that, and the percentage amount is unchanged from \#7.  

9\. LONG TERM CARE percentage is based on the calculation in \#8, expanded to  include an annual amount equal to the approximate premium for a basic LTC policy,  based on the prospect’s age. If the prospect will not have an LTC rider in their BOY  policy (either due to age, lack of state availability, or the planned use of a reduced  paid up strategy), the verbiage changes to reflect that, and the percentage amount is  unchanged from \#8.  

10\. The Premium Payments and Withdrawals are from the illustration data you supplied,  with totals calculated by the worksheet.  

11\. Client’s name and your name and information are as provided by you. The date  inserted is the date the report is created, based on your computer’s system date.  

**Page 2** 

12\. The Reality Check items are not customized.  

13\. Additional LTC Information prints only if a long term care rider is being added to the  BOY policy. Otherwise, this area is blank.  

14\. Any personal message from you.  

15\. The Notes are not customized.

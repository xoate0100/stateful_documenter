wo years ago, presidential candi-

date John McCain secured initial

campaign ﬁnancing by using his $3

million life insurance policy as collateral.

In 1980, Doris Christopher used a

life insurance loan to launch her strug-

gling kitchen gadget company. In 2002,

she sold that company—the Pampered

Chef—to Warren Buﬀett for a reported

$900 million.

Even in the midst of the Great Depres-

sion, J.C. Penney used a loan against his $3

million life insurance policy to resuscitate

his retail stores after the 1929 crash.

By this point in our nation’s recession,

it is clear that there is no such thing as a

perfect investment strategy. As the Dow

Jones Industrial Average sits at about 65

percent of its value from 18 months ago,

now is an ideal time to learn about the

proven beneﬁts, strengths, and versatility

of life insurance and annuity investing.

IF IT’S GOOD ENOUGH FOR

BANKERS . . .

According to government disclosures, Fed-

eral Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has

a majority of his liquid wealth—between $1

million and $2 million—invested in ﬁxed

and variable annuities. Fixed annuities are

contracts issued exclusively by life insur-

ance companies that promise guaranteed

rates of interest.

What’s more, the 401(k) Thrift Plan for

Employees of the Federal Reserve System,

according to a 2009 ﬁrst-quarter Fed report

covering 22,000 Fed employees, has 75

percent of its assets—that’s $3.2 billion—in-

vested in its ﬁxed-income fund, which is

invested exclusively in annuity contracts

underwritten by major U.S. life insurance

companies guaranteeing principal and an

interest rate of 5.8 percent.

And this is not a new trend. A Deloitte

audit aﬃrms that in 2007 and 2006, Fed

employees overwhelmingly chose ﬁxed-

income annuity funds over volatile mutual

funds, according to the federal reserve

system thrift plan participants, smart

investment report.

The nation’s large banks invest immense

sums of their Tier 1 capital reserves—a

bank’s most important asset and a key

measure of its strength—into permanent

life insurance underwritten by major life

insurance companies. (See sidebar “Banking

on life insurance” for more details.)

Simply put, there are two types

of life insurance—term and

permanent—and a combination

of both types works well for

most investors.

Term insurance

covers you for a specified

period of time, usually from

5 to 30 years, depending upon

your age. This, essentially,

is rented insurance.

Permanent or

cash-value life

insurance

are essentially one and the

same: insurance for as long

as you live. You own your

life insurance. Permanent

life insurance has a savings

component and a death

benefit. There are three

general types of permanent

life insurance: whole,

universal, and variable life.

Whole life

has guarantees in mortality

charges and interest, and

additional earnings in

dividends.

Universal life

is more flexible: Interest

earned is determined by

short-term money rates.

Mortality charges increase

with age.

Variable life

includes mortality charges

that can be either fixed or

increasing. The savings

component rate of return

with variable life is

determined by the rate of

return in the stock market—

thus adding significant risk.

An annuity, meanwhile,

is a contract issued by an

insurance company that

offers a guaranteed rate

of interest and guaranteed

payout options—including an

income for life. Annuities are

particularly well-suited for

retirement savings and are the

cornerstone of all pensions.

Unlike a bank or mutual

fund, an insurance company

must maintain cash reserves

equal to the annuity’s value.

OPTIONS

SORTING OUT

Why do banks look to insurance companies for sound in-

vestment? Unlike banks, life insurance companies do not use

excessive leverage. If a bank has $1 million on deposit, it can

lend out up to $10 million to the public. This leverage is called

“fractional reserve lending,” and it can lead to instability. Indeed,

excessive leverage is a major reason why banks are failing today

and have throughout history.

However, if a life insurance company has $1 million on

deposit, that company may loan no more than $920,000, and

usually only a fraction of that. As such, life insurers are 100

percent reserve-based lenders, which makes them stable in-

stitutions in down economies.

WHY LIFE INSURANCE?

There are two basic types of life insurance: term life, which is

essentially a rented policy for a speciﬁed period of time; and

permanent or “cash-value” life, which is insurance for as long

as you live. While a mix of both types of policy proves valuable

for most investors, ﬁnancial rewards are attainable only

with permanent life policies. Following are some of the

POWER

POINTS

Insurance companies

do not invest

their money in the

potentially unstable

way that banks do.

A mix of term and

permanent life

insurance is ideal for

most, though only

permanent life offers

interest rewards.

NEW LIFE FOR LIFE INSURANCE

key beneﬁts of investing in permanent

life insurance and annuities:

Safety. Permanent life and annuities,

when backed by the general account of a

life insurance company, contain ﬁnancial

guarantees and adhere to strict invest-

ment portfolio standards. Enormous

losses in today’s stock market illumi-

nate the dangers of investing without

guarantees. During the Great Depression,

when more than 10,000 banks failed,

99.9 percent of consumers’ savings in

life insurance and annuities remained

safe with legal reserve life insurance

companies.

Earnings in addition to guaran-

teed rates. Although additional earnings

above guarantees are not assured, most

life companies paid additional earnings

even during the Great Depression.

Permanent life insurance and an-

nuities are savings systems. A major

problem today in ﬁnancial planning is

that 401(k) and mutual fund marketers

have successfully blurred the diﬀerence

between “saving” and “investing.” When

one saves, money is safe and liquid. When

one invests, 100 percent of your money

is at risk 100 percent of the time.

When you save through permanent

life insurance and annuities backed by

the insurance company’s general ac-

count, your funds are safe, liquid, and

tax-favored.

Valuable tax beneﬁts. Savings and

earnings within permanent life insurance

and annuities grow tax-deferred, and loans

from insurance are not taxed as ordinary

income. What’s more, insurance proceeds

are generally received income-tax-free

and, in most cases, estate-tax-free.

Asset protection. Although asset-

protection privileges for lawsuits and

bankruptcy vary from state to state,

life insurance and annuity assets are a

favored asset in all states. States with

particularly strong asset protection for

life insurance and annuities for today’s

physician include Arizona, Florida, Michi-

gan, New York, New Mexico, Oklahoma,

and Texas.

Income-tax-free death beneﬁt. Life is

a gamble. The greatest risk we face is the

risk of premature death. Protecting those

people or causes we love with life insur-

ance is a wise allocation of resources.

When the Reverend Jerry Falwell died

in 2007, he left $34 million in life insur-

ance to pay oﬀ Liberty University’s debts,

strengthen that school’s endowment, and

provide funding for a Thomas Road Bap-

tist Church. Newer annuities also oﬀer

additional life insurance beneﬁts.

Professional money management.

Savings within a life insurance company

are professionally managed to secure the

highest rate of return with the maximum

amount of safety.

Unlike some retirement plans, you

have access to your money in a life in-

surance policy through loans and other

options. Today, money within a quali-

ﬁed retirement plan (e.g., pension, 401(k),

403(b), IRA) is money in a straitjacket until

retirement. Unfortunately, your money is

still subject to market risk and inﬂation.

Not so with permanent life insurance or

annuities that are backed by the insurer’s

general account.

Life insurance and annuities can per-

form additional economic jobs as well. By

attaching riders onto base life insurance

and annuities, they can provide additional

beneﬁts for disability protection, long-

term care, critical illness, and retirement

funding.

Life insurance and annuities are wills

unto themselves. They are able to accom-

modate multiple and complex beneﬁcia-

ries, and can be easily changed without

legal costs. At your death, they also bypass

probate—thus avoiding legal bills, appraisal

costs, taxes, and other expenses common

even to midsized estates. States with par-

ticularly onerous probate costs include

California, Connecticut, and Georgia.

column represents the total amount each bank has invested in its premises, ﬁxed assets, and other real estate. Many banks have more

invested in life insurance than they do in all of their hard assets combined. The life insurance proceeds (death beneﬁt) to the bank at the

NEW LIFE FOR LIFE INSURANCE

a year; there are costs associated with

any investment, and these are long-term

planning tools.

Finally, this author prefers mutual life

companies over publicly traded stock-based

life insurers (although stock companies

can be well-run and oﬀer investors great

value). Why mutual companies? A mutual

company is not a publicly traded entity

and does not succumb to the continuous

demands and whims of Wall Street. Mutual

companies, although not entirely unscathed,

have for the most part dodged the stock

market meltdown that has hammered their

publicly traded counterparts.

Mutual companies, often criticized for

being too prudish and conservative, are

now pillars of strength. With a mutual

company, a physician is technically an

owner in the company and receives the

proﬁts of the company through dividends

and interest—not stock.

If a mutual company does go public at a

later date, its investors can enjoy potential

rewards of cash, additional insurance, or

shares of the new public company—while

still maintaining their initial insurance

and annuities.

It is wise to work with an adviser who

has expertise not just in life insurance

and annuities, but who has a working

knowledge of taxes, risk management,

investments, and economics. Insure your

life as you would insure the economic

replacement value of your automobile,

home, or practice. Your human life is the

greatest economic value of them all—the

creator of all property values.

As a general rule, the economic re-

placement value for life insurance for a

physician under 40 is around 20 times

his annual income. Physicians who are

young will need large amounts of term life

insurance—pure death beneﬁt protection.

As cash ﬂow improves and debts such as

student loans are paid down, purchasing

permanent life insurance makes economic

sense.

When buying life insurance and an-

nuity products with savings components,

purchase products that are backed by

the general account of the company

ﬁrst. Why? The general account is the

heart of any life insurance company and,

by design, one of the safest places for

savings in America today. By choosing

general-account-backed products ﬁrst,

all financial risks are shifted onto the

insurance company.

When allocating funds to life insurance

and annuities as an asset, a commitment

of 10 to 30 percent of one’s resources is

prudent, since these instruments have

stable value and are easily convertible

into cash. The nation’s large banks con-

sistently invest between 10 to 30 percent

of their reserves—hundreds of millions of

dollars—into life insurance and annuity

products, according to the FDIC. There’s

every reason for you to do the same.

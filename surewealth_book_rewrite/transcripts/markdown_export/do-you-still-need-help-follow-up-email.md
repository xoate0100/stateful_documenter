Do You Still Need Help with Your ___________?

Hi Gang,

I mentioned on today's call the importance of sending a weekly e-mail to your prospects, ARFs,

and clients and that you will get responses when you do.

If you REALLY want to have fun; send the following exact words individually to everyone in

your database. My assistant individually emailed (should not look like a mass e-mail campaign)

a list of 300 prospects and older ARFs this week. So far, I have received 20 separate responses

and three who wish to re-open their case. One involves 2 partners in a business where they would

need very significant policies. Many people will respond by saying they are "good for now" but

do not want to be taken off the list.

The email title should be "quick question..."

The only text besides your contact information is "Do you still need help with _____________?"

The blank I used was "Retirement planning" but you can use BOY or whatever they were

considering.

Try it... and let us know what happens.

Just sent the "quick question" email out to about 500 people! WOO! Planning on scheduling for

once a year.

Great going Alan and Mark,

It is a great idea once or twice a year. Also make sure that you individually send each e-mail

personalized with the prospect's name and NOT show that it was sent by a company that

provides e-mail. For example... I use "Constant Contact" for the weekly e-mails but my assistant

sent 300 separate e-mails that DO NOT include the Constant Contact info and came directly to

them from my email address. Some mass e-mail programs do this and I may have to switch to

one that does. If you don't, then send them one by one. You can of course cut and past the tag

line and text.

Hi Steve and the Gang,

Thank you again for sharing this idea and for following through on it!

A couple thoughts and suggestions for the group:

It wasn't mentioned, but I would of course personalize each email, i.e., Hi First Name,

(FYI- "Hi" is a better salutation than "Dear.” It sounds more like it's coming from someone you

know.)

And as far as what to use where the blank is, I suspect you'd get a little better traction if you used

something a bit more descriptive than "retirement planning". I would not recommend you use

"Bank On Yourself" because they may not really know what it is or means.

I'd suggest trying something like:

Do you still need help with growing your retirement savings safely and predictably?

They may have little interest in "retirement planning" or they may have someone who does that

for them so they think they are covered in that area, but they may want a safer way to do that.

Keep us posted on how this is working for you all!

I am batting 1,000 so far with the few emails I have sent. I used educational planning and self-

financing in the emails as well as retirement planning, as those areas were hot buttons with those

particular people.

I sent it out with "retirement planning" to all my "simmer" leads - 442 emails. Of those, 2%

bounced, and 40% opened the email (181 people). Of these 181, 46 people replied - all saying

"not at this time" or similar. I wrote them back asking if they'd like to be taken off the lists we

have, and 40 wanted to keep in the loop with our workshops, newsletters etc.

Didn't lead directly to any new business, but some folks asked me to send the email again in the

next year, so I've already got it auto scheduled!

Hi Mark and the Gang,

I STRONGLY suggest testing a phrase that's more "descriptive" than "retirement planning." I'm

not surprised that most people would say they aren't interested in "retirement planning" right

now. What does that even mean to people? Doesn't every other advisor do "retirement planning?

What makes what you do different?

And as Steven suggested, and Alan discovered, the more closely what you use for that phrase

matches what they TOLD you was a hot-button for them, the better your results will be.

Yes, this involves more time - you can't send out a bulk email, and you really shouldn't anyway.

Plus, your assistant can do this.

Try it! You might be amazed by the results. It's nice that people are responding and saying keep

me on your list, but even better is when they say, "Yes, I'm still interested, and I want to talk to

you about that!"

I like this change Pamela! I'll keep it ready to send as soon as the next market correction of say

10% or so happens. Might get better response!

I tried it with a little twist – I sent a text message to previously unresponsive ARFs… It just said

“Are you still interested in learning more about Bank On Yourself?” Sent 12 text messages and

received 5 “yes” responses within minutes, I did not receive any “no” responses. I sent out 3

books, booked one initial call appointment and expect to book two more from the people I sent

books to…

What I found most interesting is that I actually had a couple of meaningful “conversations” by

text message. I exchanged 23 text messages back and forth with the guy who booked the initial

appointment – and this is someone I’ve emailed and left voice messages for multiple times with

no response… “Curiouser and curiouser!”

I think a more appropriate descriptive message would be “Lifetime Income Planning.”

Way to go, John! We have such creative members, and that's why I want everyone to share

EXACTLY what they're testing, along with their results.

And Keith, I was having a similar thought to yours (lifetime income planning), though there is no

such thing as a most appropriate phrase - you can only know by testing, and different things will

work differently with different people.

Along the same lines, you could test:

ensuring your money lasts as long as you do

lifetime financial security

And I'll bet our members can come up with more good ideas!, Again, if you KNOW the person's

hot button from talking to them or their ARF, that will generally work the best.

Do you still need help with setting your very own SUCCESSFUL BANK ON YOURSELF

LIFE-LONG CASH FLOW MONEY MANAGEMENT SAVINGS AND ACQUISITION

SYSTEM?

In our initial batch, we sent out 32 to our non-responsive ARFs. Most had indicated an interest in

retirement planning, so our email said, “Do you still have an interest in creating a predictable

retirement income?”

So far we’ve had 2 replies. One said not at this time and the other one said Yes. I had a lengthy

phone call with that one and he’s going to start a plan.

With our next batch, which will go out soon, we’re going to start tracking whether or not the

emails get opened, because I know that a certain percentage of our emails end up in a spam

folder.

I had Colleen do the same with 22 non-responsive ARFs and got two replies back to start the

process. We used Steve’s wording so we can change it up a bit and try it again.

How can you send a text message to someone, when you don’t know their cell phone number?

Or did you only send texts to cell phones?

Jim,

The phone number provided on the ARF is a cell phone number the vast majority of the time. I

had one text message that kicked back to me with a message that it could not be delivered

because it was a land line – but it gave me the option of having my text message automatically

converted and delivered as a voice message for 25 cents… Pretty cool! I think fewer and fewer

people have a “home” telephone anymore and their cell phone is their primary phone for

everything… I haven’t had a “land line” myself for years now…

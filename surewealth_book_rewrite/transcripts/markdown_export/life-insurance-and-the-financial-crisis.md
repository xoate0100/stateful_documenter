NOLHGA, THE LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE GUARANTY SYSTEM, AND

THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2008-2009

Peter G. Gallanis*

Introduction.  Since the early 1970s, life, annuity, and health insurance

consumers have received protection against the financial risk of the insolvency of their

insurer from guaranty associations (GAs) in their states of residence.

1

Participants in the 2009 ABA/TIPS program have a particular interest in the “next

level” of receiverships and the use of run-off techniques in today’s very challenging

economic environment.  Among other things, this paper addresses the extensive use of

run-off concepts in prior multi-state life insurer insolvency cases and the potential use of

GA-supported runoffs, should the current economic crisis cause the insolvency of one or

more nationally significant insurers.  Conventional run-off techniques have long been a

basic option in the guaranty system’s “playbook.”

Fifty-two

guaranty associations (for the 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia)

coordinate consumer protection in major insolvencies (those involving multiple states)

through their membership in the National Organization of Life and Health Insurance

Guaranty Associations (NOLHGA), a not-for-profit corporation organized in 1983.

NOLHGA’s members have protected consumers in many life and health company

failures, including roughly 75 multi-state insolvency cases.

The purpose of this paper is to discuss briefly the mission of the life guaranty

system (Part I); the development of the guaranty system in the context of U.S. insurer

insolvency resolutions (Part II); the operations of the guaranty system when insurers fail

(Part III); and the financial capacity of the guaranty system (Part IV).

1Reflecting the essential separation of the life and health insurance industry from the property and casualty

insurance industry, property/casualty consumers are protected by a separate network of guaranty funds

coordinated through the National Conference of Insurance Guaranty Funds (NCIGF).  Unless otherwise

independently or through NOLHGA.

developed a reputation in some quarters as being critical of the use of run-off techniques in receiverships.

To the contrary, the author is fully supportive of run-offs in the sense that the concept conventionally has

been used, although he has criticized the use of the term “run-off” to describe some very unconventional

I.

The Guaranty System’s Mission.

The core mission of NOLHGA and its member GAs is to assure that consumers

receive at least a statutorily prescribed base level of financial protection when a life or

health insurance company fails.  That protection may be achieved either by transferring to

a healthy insurer the failed company’s business in force or by supporting the run-off of

that business.

II.

Historical Development of the Guaranty System and Insurer

Insolvency Resolutions.

History of Life Insurance Failures in the U.S.  Life insurer failures have

occasionally occurred throughout the history of the U.S. life insurance industry. Because

insurance has historically been regulated by the states rather than by the federal

government, insurance company failures have been governed by state insolvency

procedures rather than by federal bankruptcy law.  For reasons discussed herein,

insurance consumers have often been better shielded from harm in state insurance

insolvency proceedings than creditors have been in bankruptcies or other types of

receivership proceedings.

Until the early 1970s, there was no widespread “safety net” to protect insurance

consumers when an insurer failed.  Consumers became creditors of the failed insurer in

an insolvency proceeding, and when they made claims against the “estate” of the insurer

for policy benefits, they could experience delays or reductions in payment of their claims.

They were also at risk as to the amount of any payment that would eventually be

received.  That is, they faced risks regarding both timing (whether the insurer’s estate

would have the liquidity to pay obligations to consumers as they came due), and amount

(whether the credit of the insurer would recover so that the insurance estate’s assets

would be sufficient to satisfy policy liabilities).

In addition, consumers often confronted the need to replace in the marketplace

what amounted to defaulted “permanent” policies of the failed insurer.3

and troubling proposals.  See, e.g., Gallanis, The “New Runoff”: Threat or Menace?” XIII NOLHGA

Journal No. 1, p.2 (January 2007).

Consumers

3 The risk mentioned here relates only to “permanent” insurance, and not all insurance policies are

permanent. Property and casualty policies are generally renewable and re-priced each year, and are

cancellable either by the insurer or by the insured as each year’s policy term expires.  The same is true of

many types of health insurance policies (e.g., group health insurance policies).  To the extent policies are

“reset” each year, the replacement risk is minimal or nonexistent, since such contracts can generally be

replaced on reasonable terms in the marketplace.  The primary consumer risk in such cases is the loss of

prepaid installments of premium for the year in which the insurer becomes insolvent (sometimes called

(continued . . .)

attempting to replace such policies usually faced, at a minimum, higher premiums, since

they would be older than when they purchased the original policies.  In some cases,

changes in consumers’ health since they purchased the original policies rendered them

uninsurable at any premium level.

The Creation of the Guaranty System.  By the early 1970s there was a national

consensus that life, annuity, and health consumers should be protected against three

major insolvency risks: delays in payment of claims (liquidity risks), uncertainty as to the

amounts of any payments received (credit risks), and the risks and costs of replacing the

insurer’s defaulted permanent policies (replacement risks).  (A similar consensus also

then formed regarding protection of property/casualty consumers, leading to the

development of the property/casualty guaranty funds.)

That consensus led the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)

to develop the 1971 Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Model Act (Model

Act).  The NAIC has amended and updated the Model Act several times, and it serves as

the statutory foundation for the legislation in 52 jurisdictions creating the GAs that are

members of NOLHGA.  Each state’s version of the Model Act created a GA within the

state as a specially chartered, not-for-profit legal entity with the power and responsibility

to protect consumers against the liquidity, credit, and policy replacement risks posed by a

life or health insurer insolvency.  Each GA’s membership includes all the insurance

companies licensed to write covered lines of business in the state.  Those “member

insurers” bear the costs of protecting consumers in proportion to their market shares in

the state.4

“unearned premium claims”), a risk that is now covered both by property/casualty guaranty funds and by

life and health GAs.

4 Some state GA enabling laws permit member companies to recoup some of the costs of supporting the

guaranty system through various state tax offset provisions.

The emergence of the insurance guaranty systems (life and health and

property/casualty) in the 1970s and 1980s was timely.  Until the 1980s, insolvencies of

major, national insurers had been rare.  Beginning in the 1980s and continuing into the

early 1990s, several notable insurer failures took place.  These included property/casualty

carriers Reserve Insurance Company, Mission Insurance Company, and Transit Casualty

Company.  The first major life company failure in over a generation was that of Baldwin-

United in 1983.   Baldwin-United’s failure was followed by a string of life and health

company failures in the early 1990s,including major insurers Executive Life Insurance

Company (1991), Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company (1991), and Confederation

Life Insurance Company (1994), along with a number of smaller companies.  The

number and severity of life and health insurer insolvencies declined after the mid-1990s,

and there have been no failures of nationally significant life carriers since the insolvency

of Confederation Life in 1994.  Exhibit 1 contains a list of life and health insurance

companies doing business in multiple states that have failed since 1987, together with a

chart illustrating the distribution of company failures by year.

Lessons Learned from Insolvency Experiences.  The life industry and its financial

and actuarial consultants, the life insurance ratings agencies, and state insurance

regulators learned some important lessons from the company failures of the late 1980s

and early 1990s.  One involved the need for more-sophisticated systems to measure

insurance and investment risk in life insurers, which in turn led to the development and

refinement of risk-based capital testing.  Another lesson was the need for coordinated,

sophisticated, national regulatory consultation regarding troubled companies doing

business nationally.  Other lessons involved the need for skilled, professional leadership

of, and stakeholder participation in, the processes to resolve insolvencies of nationally

significant insurers.

Recent Life Insolvency Experience.  These lessons have resulted in an industry

that now appears better prepared than others to withstand national economic challenges.

Despite the effects of the economic situation of the past 18 months on investment banks,

commercial banks and thrifts, hedge funds, credit unions, “monolines,” and government-

sponsored mortgage entities, not a single life insurer has had to be liquidated since the

start of 2008 as a consequence of the economic downturn.5

5 AIG, though often described as “the world’s largest insurance company,” is a diversified conglomerate

whose financial crisis peaked in September 2008, largely as a consequence of derivatives transactions in its

Financial Products Division.  Regulators report that the insurance subsidiaries remain healthy, although

some AIG life subsidiaries apparently experienced problems in 2008 stemming from non-traditional

“securities lending” programs.  Aside from AIG, the one multi-state life insolvency in 2008 appears to have

resulted entirely from management looting, and the one multi-state health insolvency appears to have

resulted from litigation losses.  Two multi-state life companies entered rehabilitation proceedings in the

first six months of 2009, but neither has entered liquidation.

Life company failures since the early 1990s have generally resulted in favorable

outcomes because of some basic attributes of life insurer insolvencies described below in

Part III; the increasing use of “prompt corrective action” approaches by regulators; and

increasingly professional, transparent, and participatory insolvency resolutions.  A

“favorable outcome” in this sense means one involving very small shortfalls of assets

versus liabilities and a very high percentage of returns on policyholder claims in the

“estate” of the failed insurer.  These points are addressed further in Part III.

The existence of a guaranty system providing a safety net against policyholder

losses from company insolvencies appears to have helped shore up consumer confidence

in the life industry in the current economic climate.  As discussed in Part IV, however,

some media reports have questioned the financial capacity of the guaranty system to

withstand an unprecedented financial crisis.

While the actual financial capacity of the guaranty system is quite substantial, it is

not unlimited.  As discussed below in Part IV, a completely unprecedented, worst-case

crisis for the life industry could in theory challenge the liquidity of the guaranty system,

but even in that event the system would still have strategies available to protect

consumers.

III.

How the Guaranty System Operates Within the Insolvency

Resolution Process.

In the banking system, the FDIC has two roles:  it provides a safety net for

banking consumers, and it regulates (indirectly and sometimes directly).  By contrast, the

insurance guaranty system’s consumer safety net is separate and apart from the regulation

of active insurers.  Nonetheless, NOLHGA and its member guaranty associations

coordinate their activities closely with the operations of insurance regulators and

receivers.

The Nature of U.S. Insurance Receiverships.  U.S. insurance companies are

expressly excluded from the definition of a “debtor” under the federal Bankruptcy Code.

As a consequence, a failed insurance company does not enter bankruptcy, but rather is

placed in receivership by the insurance regulator of the state that granted the insurer’s

charter.  The receivership proceeding is conducted according to the state’s insurance

receivership statute, which in every state bears some resemblance to bankruptcy law.

The proceeding is conducted before a state judge, and the insurance commissioner of the

“domiciliary state” serves as the statutory receiver of the company.

Insurance receivership laws vary somewhat from state to state, but all have

provisions for three basic levels of receivership.  The first (and least severe) is often

described as “conservation.”  Conservation is a process in which the insurance

commissioner, as conservator, maintains the status quo (e.g., custody of records and

assets) while determining the seriousness of the insurer’s problems.  If the conservator is

satisfied that any significant problems have been addressed, the company can be released

from conservation.  If not, the company may proceed to either of the more severe forms

of receivership.

The next most severe form is “rehabilitation,” in which the commissioner, as

rehabilitator, is vested with title to the company’s assets and control of company

operations.  Rehabilitation is in some ways analogous to a Chapter 11 bankruptcy

reorganization.  The objective, if possible, is to develop a court-approved plan of

rehabilitation intended to address the problems that made the receivership necessary.  The

outcome may be the eventual release of the company from rehabilitation, or it may be the

most severe form of receivership, “liquidation.”

Liquidation is analogous to a Chapter 7 liquidating bankruptcy.  The

commissioner, as liquidator, is charged with responsibility for marshaling the assets of

the insurer, evaluating the claims of policyholders and other creditors against the insurer,

and distributing the marshaled assets to approved claimants in the manner prescribed by

the state’s receivership law.

The Role of GAs in Receiverships.  Under the Model Act as adopted in the states,

NOLHGA’s member GAs become actively involved in an insurer insolvency resolution

when their obligations to consumers are “triggered” by an order of the receivership court

placing the insurance company into liquidation and finding it to be insolvent.

GA Coverage Obligations.  Once triggered, a GA becomes responsible for

protecting contracts covered under its enabling statute, at least to the lower of (i) the

contract’s limit of coverage; or (ii) the limit of coverage or “cap” set forth in the GA’s

enabling statute.  Virtually all of the enabling statutes provide coverage for each covered

contract at least to the cap levels set forth in the Model Act; the legislatures of some

states have chosen to provide higher GA caps for some lines of business than those in the

Model Act.  The coverage caps for the different GAs are graphically illustrated in the

brochure included as Exhibit 2, The Nation’s Safety Net.6

In general, all traditional consumer-oriented life and annuity contracts that are

guaranteed by a life insurance company are covered by GAs, subject to coverage limits.

Under the Model Act, life insurance death benefits are covered to a cap of $300,000, and

cash values are covered to $100,000; annuities guaranteed by the insurer (fixed annuities

and guaranties attached to certain variable annuities) are covered to a cap of $250,000;

7

Flexibility in Manner of Satisfying GA Obligations.  The enabling statutes provide

GAs some flexibility in how to deliver mandated protections to consumers,

and health benefits, depending on the type of contract, are covered to between $100,000

and $500,000.  (See Exhibit 2 for further details.)  Guaranty associations do not cover

contractual benefits that are not guaranteed by the insurer, or as to which the consumer

has agreed to bear market risks (e.g., fluctuations in the value of variable annuity

portfolios that are not the subject of insurer guaranties).

8

6 On March 17, 2009 the NAIC amended the Model Act to change the coverage cap for annuities from

$100,000 to $250,000 and to establish a new $300,000 cap for long-term care and disability insurance

coverage.  In anticipation of that change, some state legislatures had already begun the process of amending

their GA enabling statutes to implement the new, higher limits of GA coverage.

7 This is the cap commencing March 17, 2009; the prior limit was $100,000.  (See preceding footnote.)

8 The Model Act, in language adopted in virtually all state GA enabling statutes, provides that when a

“member insurer” is deemed “insolvent ,” the consumer protection options open to the GA are to

“guaranty, assume or reinsure, or cause to be guaranteed, assumed or reinsured, the policies or contracts of

the insolvent insurer.”  Model Act 8(B)(1)(a)(i).

including the

power to tailor a resolution plan to achieve a “least cost resolution” while also preserving

guaranty system financial capacity when it may be prudent to do so.  The GAs’ core

obligations are to make payments due on covered contracts and to continue coverage on

those contracts on substantially the same terms as those extended to consumers by the

failed insurer.  By meeting those obligations, GAs relieve consumers of the liquidity,

credit, and replacement risks they otherwise would face from the insolvency of their

insurers.

The Role of NOLHGA.  NOLHGA was formed in 1983 to provide a mechanism

through which multiple GAs could act in concert to craft a single, national insolvency

response plan for multi-state insolvency cases.  NOLHGA, which is based in Herndon,

VA, has a small staff of insurance, legal, and administrative personnel who support the

coordinated activities of the life insurance guaranty system.

# Page 8

In most life insurer insolvencies, GAs deliver protections to resident consumers

through one of two types of resolution strategies – assumption reinsurance transactions or

“enhancement plans” in which the GAs provide financial support for the conventional

run-off of the policies of the insolvent insurer.  In either case, contracts effecting the

strategy are executed by NOLHGA and affirmed by each of the GAs participating in the

resolution.

Assumption Reinsurance Transactions.  Particularly in smaller insolvencies (or in

periods when insolvencies are few and isolated), a resolution plan may involve the

transfer of the in-force obligations of the failed insurer to a healthy insurer.  The new

carrier agrees to assume these liabilities (in what is commonly known as an “assumption

reinsurance” transaction) in exchange for a transfer of assets from the estate of the failed

insurer plus the GAs’ payment of an amount that satisfies the obligations of GAs to their

resident consumers.  In an assumption reinsurance transaction, the GAs usually bear the

costs of protecting consumers at the time the transaction closes; in other words, the GAs

pay at the “front end” all of the costs they will ever bear for protecting consumers in such

a resolution plan.

Enhancement Plans in Extended Run-offs.  Alternatively, GAs may participate in

a resolution plan in which they supply enhancing funds to the assets of the insolvency

estate, and apply  those enhancing funds as needed over time (years or even decades) to

pay insurance and annuity obligations as the insolvent insurer’s obligations come due

over an extended run-off period.  By participating in such an enhancement plan, rather

than an assumption reinsurance transaction, GAs can defer having to fund their

obligations to consumers until the time when those obligations actually mature.

Enhancement plans have been used in a number of insolvency cases, particularly when

the size of the case or concerns about maximizing the financial capacity of the guaranty

system appeared to justify such a strategy.

In either case (an assumption reinsurance agreement or enhancement plan), GA

funds are combined with available assets from the estate to finance the costs of protecting

consumers.

The Significance of Estate Assets.  Two other aspects of life insurer insolvencies

are important in this connection.  First, most life insurer insolvencies involve only small

shortfalls of assets versus liabilities.  The shortfalls are seldom more than 15% in larger

cases, and are more typically in the range of 5% to 10%.  Second, under the insurance

receivership statutes of all states, when estate assets are distributed, policyholders have an

absolute priority over the lower-ranking claims of general creditors and subordinated

creditors.  As discussed in Part IV, these two facts, combined with GAs’ ability to utilize

enhancement plans to spread their obligations over a multi-year run-off, permit GAs to

respond to peak years of insolvency activity (historically concentrated in a couple of bad

years within a much longer cycle of relative calm) by spreading their resolution costs

over a much longer period.   In effect, GAs are able to defer their need for financing to

# Page 9

match the maturity of payment obligations on covered insurance and annuity contracts.9

GAs Protect Consumers, Not Failed Insurers.  The core responsibility of GAs is

to protect consumers whose insurers have failed – not the insurers.  Stated differently,

GAs were not created to “bail out” financially troubled insurance companies, but rather to

assure that individual consumers receive a base level of financial protection during their

insurers’ insolvency resolution process.

In this way the guaranty system is able to avoid the outcome of “drowning in a stream

having an average depth of nine inches.”

10

Resolution Plan Financing from GAs.  Even with the funding from estate assets,

additional funds from the guaranty system are often critical to the success of a resolution

plan.  The guaranty system’s funds “bridge the gap” between the total GA-covered

IV.

Guaranty System Financing and Capacity Considerations.

The guaranty system relies upon a combination of financing sources and

resolution techniques to deliver protection for consumers.  A clear picture of the financial

capacity of the system requires an understanding of those sources and resolution

techniques.

Estate Assets Provide Significant Resolution Plan Financing.  Life insurer

resolution plans employ the insolvent insurer’s remaining assets as the first level of

financing used to protect all insurance consumers pro rata – both for consumer benefits

covered by GAs and for insurance benefits that GAs do not cover (e.g., policy or annuity

benefits in excess of GA “caps”).

Additionally, as noted above, U.S. insurance receivership laws give policy-level

claims priority over all other claims against an insolvent insurer’s assets (aside from

receivership administrative costs).  This priority (requiring policy-level claims to be paid

first, and in full, before any payment of general creditors’ or subordinated claims) boosts

the financial resources available for the resolution plan.  Moreover, the conservative

nature of life insurance investing, strong regulation, and rating agency pressure usually

make the “shortfall” of assets to liabilities relatively small for failed life insurers –

particularly for larger, diversified insurers.  Except in the cases of a few small life

companies where management “looted” the insurers’ assets, shortfalls in excess of 25%

of policy liabilities are almost unheard of; shortfalls in the range of 5% to 10% are more

typical.

9 GAs also have statutory authority to borrow money against the pledge of future assessments.

10 The Model Act (Section 8(A)(2)) and the enabling statutes for most GAs do permit a GA to lend funds to

an “impaired” insurer chartered by the GA’s state.  (An “impaired” insurer is one under regulatory

supervision or control but for whom GA coverage has not been triggered by a judicial order of liquidation

with a finding of insolvency.)  To date that provision has rarely been used.

# Page 10

obligations and the estate assets allocable to meet those obligations.  Simply stated, GAs

must cover that gap for the consumers they are charged to protect.11

Post-Insolvency Funding.  Unlike the FDIC, the insurance guaranty mechanism

does not involve a pre-funded “war chest” available in advance of a particular insolvency.

Rather, the funding structure may be described as a post-insolvency funding system, in

which assessments are collected only when they are needed to help pay the costs of

insurance benefits coming due to consumers.  The advantage of this approach is that

capital is not removed from the industry prior to the need for such capital, and consumers

are not required to pay in advance (through higher premiums) for funds that may never be

needed to protect other consumers in an insolvency.

GA Assessment Funding from Member Companies.  The most significant source

of GA funding is through assessments that GAs collect from the insurance industry.

Each GA is authorized by its enabling statute to assess and collect, from insurance

companies writing covered lines of business in the state (the GA’s “member insurers”),

the amount needed to satisfy the GA’s obligations to policyholders.  Member insurers are

obliged to pay those assessments, which are allocated ratably in accordance with their

market shares, as a condition to maintaining their authority to write business in the state.

For that reason, collection of GA assessments has never been a problem for the guaranty

system.  The Model Act limits the amount that can be assessed to any company in a given

year to 2% of insurers’ recent average annual premiums.  (A few state GA enabling

statutes have assessment “cap” provisions that are greater or less than the Model Act’s

2% cap.)

Distributions to GAs from Prior Insolvencies.  Another source of GA funding is

“dividend” distributions to GAs from insurance receiverships in which GAs previously

have advanced funds to protect consumers.  The source of these dividend distributions

may include (i) the realization over time of value from the sale of distressed assets in the

portfolio of a failed insurer; or (ii) judgments or settlements eventually obtained by the

receiver against insiders or consultants who bore responsibility for the failure of the

company.

12

11 Technically, the GAs are responsible for the entire amount of a consumer’s GA-covered benefits. Under

the Model Act and state GA enabling statutes, however, to the extent a GA provides protection, it is

“subrogated” to the consumer’s claim as a creditor of the insolvent insurer, and the GA is entitled to pro

rata access to the assets of the failed insurer to satisfy its subrogation claim.  Thus, if an insolvent insurer’s

estate has zero assets (as in the rare case where all assets have been looted by management), the GAs are

responsible for paying 100% of covered benefits.  But if the insurer has available assets to cover a portion

(say, 90%) of policy-level claims, the GAs are for practical purposes responsible to pay the remaining

portion (10%) of covered benefits, with the balance being “financed” from estate assets applied to satisfy

the GA’s subrogation claims.

12 While GAs are not formally pre-funded in the sense that the FDIC is, most GAs have made recoveries

over the years from the estates of insolvent insurers after assessing the life industry for the cost of

providing protection to insolvent insurers' policyholders.  As a result, most GAs today have significant

“cash on hand” providing at least a modest operating reserve that can be brought to bear immediately in

response to one or more new insolvencies.

# Page 11

10

The disadvantage of a post-insolvency funding system is obviously the lack of

ready funds in advance of a funding need.  For an insurance safety net, however, this is

not the disadvantage that it might seem.

The historical justification for FDIC pre-funding is the need to support full access

to bank savings and checking accounts, which are presumed to be demand obligations of

the insured institution that must be fully liquid to satisfy the essential promise to the

consumer reflected in the banking relationship.  Insurance and annuity products, by

contrast, are in essence commitments to deliver funding upon specified events (e.g., the

death of an insured under a life policy) or pursuant to a scheduled need (e.g., installment

obligations payable under a fixed annuity contract).  Unlike a demand account, many

insurance obligations do not become due and payable to consumers until years after an

insurer’s failure.

To provide an effective banking safety net, it is necessary for the FDIC to replace

cash (of the failed bank) with cash from the FDIC at the moment the bank fails.  By

contrast, the insurance guaranty system, by protecting not only against liquidity and

credit risks, but also against insurance replacement risks, meets its obligations to

consumers in a different way that is appropriate to the nature of an insurance contract, by

replacing insurance with insurance.

Maximum Guaranty System Assessment Capacity.  The theoretical maximum of

assessments that may be collected across the guaranty system in a given year can be

roughly calculated by applying each state’s “assessment cap” to the total of the currently

assessable premiums within the state, and adding those amounts for all 52 GAs.  That

exercise generates a theoretical national assessment maximum for the current year of

approximately $8.8 billion, including about $4.7 billion regarding life and annuity

premiums (generally available only to cover consumer benefits for life and annuity

business) and $4.1 billion regarding health premiums (generally available only to cover

health benefits).13

Measuring the Guaranty System’s Ability to Respond.  The current economic

situation has caused various media outlets to publish stories about the potential failures of

life insurance companies.  Some of those stories have briefly addressed the guaranty

system, but few have done so in detail, and none have done so accurately.  Some stories

have described the guaranty system as having “capital” of $8 billion or $9 billion; others

13 The theoretical maximum so calculated is a useful “rule of thumb,” but it has limitations.  GA capacity is

further constrained by at least three “silo” factors.  The first is that a single GA’s capacity is not available to

satisfy obligations of another GA.  Second, as noted in the text, most GAs follow the Model Act provisions

limiting the use of life and annuity assessments to the provision of life and annuity coverage, and health

assessments to the provision of health coverage.  Finally, a GA may assess to cover only the costs of

protecting its own residents, and some failed insurers may have unusually high or low concentrations of

business in particular states.  Insolvencies of relatively large life and annuity writers do, however, tend to

follow a relatively normal distribution that matches GA coverage costs fairly closely with the states where

assessable premium is collected.  In other words, assessment capacity is generally distributed among states

in a pattern similar to the costs of providing GA protection.

# Page 12

11

have described the total capacity of the system as being limited to $8 billion or $9 billion.

The stories then typically compare the cited amounts to the total liabilities of life insurers,

and conclude or imply that the capacity of the guaranty system is inadequate to protect

consumers.

Such assertions are incomplete and unsound for two important reasons.

Accounting for Estate Assets.  The first reason is that such assertions fail to

account for the very significant extent to which the costs of protecting life insurance

consumers are almost always paid from assets that remain with the insurer after it has

entered liquidation proceedings.  For example, if an insurer with $10 billion of in-force

business (all GA-covered) were to fail this year and be the subject of a GA-supported

assumption reinsurance transaction, also effected this year, the cost to the guaranty

system would not be $10 billion.  Rather, it would be the net amount remaining after

subtracting from $10 billion the available assets in the insurer’s “estate.”  If the insurer

had (not atypically) 90 cents available to cover every dollar of policyholder liability, the

costs to the guaranty system would be $1 billion, not $10 billion.14

To be sure, the assessment base for each future year into which the cost of

resolving a current-year insolvency would thus be shifted would also need to be available

to pay GA costs for other insolvencies – whether insolvencies arising in that future year

or from other, prior years.  The point is still important, though, because of the cyclicality

of insolvencies and the relative steadiness – and historically steady increases – in the

overall assessment capacity of the guaranty system.  Historically, the guaranty system’s

aggregate assessment capacity for most years has far exceeded the amount needed to

protect consumers.  That point is graphically illustrated by group Exhibit 3, which shows

the total assessment capacity of the guaranty system each year (in the aggregate and by

Accounting for the Ability of GAs to Match Funding Requirements with Maturing

Insurer Obligations over an Extended Run-Off Period.  The second reason is that such

assertions fail to recognize that, in major insolvencies, the guaranty system is likely to

employ an enhancement plan to spread the cost of protecting consumers across the period

of years over which the insolvent insurers’ obligations to consumers mature.  Such a run-

off enhancement plan decreases the extent to which the guaranty system’s assessment

capacity is depleted for any one year by a particular insolvency.  Another way to express

this point is to view the relevant “capacity” measure for the guaranty system not as the

assessment capacity for the current year alone, but rather as the cumulative assessment

capacity for the years across which consumer benefits would be covered by GAs.  For

some types of life or annuity contracts, the delivery of such benefits may span a run-off

period of decades or even generations.

14 Additionally, for many types of business transferred in assumption reinsurance transactions, the

acquiring company will pay a significant “ceding commission” in recognition of the cost of acquiring such

a block of contracts.  Such ceding commissions can further reduce the net guaranty system cost of

protecting consumers.

separate lines of business), compared to the total funds actually collected from GA

member companies to pay for the delivery of covered benefits to consumers.

Guaranty System Capacity in the Current Economic Crisis.  The question really

being asked, though, by those who have written about the potential effects of the

economic crisis on the insurance industry and the guaranty system, is whether the

guaranty system is capable of protecting consumers if the current economic crisis

continues to grow worse.  To state the question somewhat differently, could the guaranty

system meet its obligations if the crisis resulted in the simultaneous failure of several

nationally significant insurers?

The answer from historical experience is “yes.”  During the last major wave of

life insurer insolvencies in the early 1990s, the guaranty system protected all consumers

to whom it had responsibilities when confronted with the simultaneous resolutions of

three nationally significant insurer failures (Executive Life Insurance Company, Mutual

Benefit Life Insurance Company, and Confederation Life Insurance Company), plus a

number of failures involving middle-tier and smaller companies.  At no time – not even

in the most expensive years – did the cost of protecting consumers even remotely

approach the assessment capacity of the guaranty system.  (See Exhibit 3.)

In the current environment, NOLHGA expects that the guaranty system will be

able to meet obligations to all consumers under any reasonably foreseeable

developments.  Still, responsible questions may be asked about what is reasonably

possible.  For that reason, NOLHGA is currently involved in a “stress test” analysis

project supported by the life actuarial resources of Towers Perrin/Tillinghast and

insurance insolvency expertise from the law firm Baker & Daniels.

Preliminary results of the stress test analysis indicate that the financial capacity of

the guaranty system for 2009 standing alone – without “shifting” any of the costs of

major insolvencies into future years, as would commonly be done through an

enhancement plan (see discussion above) – should be sufficient to support guaranty

system assumption reinsurance resolutions of several nationally significant insolvencies

effected entirely within 2009, depending on the assumptions used for stress test

modeling.  But assuming (as would likely be the case) that the resolution plan would

spread the costs to the guaranty system over the extended runoff period when insurance

obligations to consumers would mature (e.g., death benefit payments, installments on

annuities) through an enhancement plan, it can be demonstrated clearly that the

assessment capacity of today’s guaranty system could handle the simultaneous failures of

a number of nationally significant insurers.

Still, if the economy were to worsen to “near meltdown” conditions, it is at least

theoretically possible that the costs of paying maturing obligations to consumers in the

current period could strain or exceed the liquidity of the system.  Under such a worst-case

scenario, one alternative for protecting consumers might be a borrowing by the guaranty

system, through conventional or extraordinary channels, secured by a pledge of some

portion of the future assessments that would be collected by GAs.  Assuming that the

# Page 14

13

current nationwide assessment base of the guaranty system would remain flat for the

period of the next 10 years (Exhibit 4A), the potential collateral stream for such a

borrowing would aggregate approximately $88 billion.  Assuming alternatively that the

current assessment base would drop by 20% and not recover at all for a period of 10

years, the potential collateral stream would still aggregate $71 billion.

Conclusions

Insurance consumers have for decades benefitted from a robust system of

insolvency protection provided by life and health insurance guaranty associations

coordinated through NOLHGA.  The system is experienced, well financed, and armed

with legal and financial tools that permit the system to manage successfully virtually any

foreseeable economic scenario.  Even in the event of a “1,000 year flood” affecting the

life insurance industry, the ability of the system to make use of the assets of insolvent

insurers in conjunction with GA assessments; to spread resolution costs over the long

run-off period when consumer benefits would mature; and to borrow against the future

assessment capacity of the system, should serve as a solid foundation for protecting

consumers.

Indexed Universal Life versus Dividend

Paying Whole Life

Here are four reasons why Indexed Universal Life (IUL) policies aren’t generally recommended

when you want predictable, guaranteed growth and/or if you intend to use the policy for

becoming your own financing source, as is the case with Bank On Yourself.  This information

comes from a top executive at a major life

insurance company that sells both IUL and

Dividend-Paying Whole Life policies:

Like all Universal Life (UL) policies, IUL is

essentially term insurance plus a side fund.  Net

premiums (premiums less any premium load)

are deposited into the side fund and cost of

insurance and expense loads are taken from the

side fund.  If the side fund is large enough to

support all of the money that has to come out of

it (including loans, loan interest, and withdrawals), the policy is workable in a self-financing

context.  If it does not, the policy may lapse and the lapse may cause a taxable event.

How likely is a lapse to happen?  If funded at the max throughout the policy’s lifetime, not very

likely, but there are a few things that need to be considered:

If the IUL policy has been designed using a guideline premium test for life

insurance, the maximum amount of premium that can be put in the policy will

generally be lower than the maximum amount of premium that can be put in a

whole life policy that has been designed using the cash value accumulation

test for life insurance.  Less money in the policy will result in a lower cash

value build up, unless the cash value buildup consistently receives a higher

interest rate.

The IUL policy could be designed to take more cash by either buying an increasing death benefit

or buying more insurance, but in both cases, you have increased the amount of insurance

coverage that has to be funded and that may result in lower cash values.

The potential for lower cash value development should be overcome by the

higher interest rates credited to the IUL policy, but here you have to be

careful not to confuse the illustration with reality.

Our IUL policy can currently be illustrated at 8%.  It was designed to have a

higher illustrated rate and this rate is supported by both the economy and the

loads that have been built into the product. (All things being equal, a product with a higher

illustrated rate will generally have higher loads than the one with a lower illustrated rate.  After

all we are buying the instruments that support these rates from the same sources as everyone

else. The money has to come from somewhere.)

But the fact that a product is illustrated at 8% does not

mean it will get 8% in any year

First of all, the cap rates will change as economic conditions change.  Second, the market does

not always go up.  Out of the last ten years, the market (i.e. the S&P index in this case) has been

up in only 4 years which means that in six of the last ten years the product hasn’t earned

anything, although mortality and loads are still coming out. The results advisors show their

prospects (that make IUL look so enticing), are based on the product returning 8% in all

years. It is not going to happen!

One of the features of most contemporary IULs is the “non-direct recognition

loan”.  The company charges a loan interest rate, but the fact that there is a

loan does not affect the crediting rate on the policy.  Thus if you have an

illustration with a 6% loan rate and an 8% illustrated rate, you are illustrating

a 2% gain on the loaned amount.  You

would be ahead to take every dime out

of the policy and reinvest it.  But this mechanism has the

same problem as above; if there is no gain in the S&P, there

is no credit to the policy.

If you had borrowed 50% of your cash value and in six out

of ten years there was no gain in the policy, you could

reduce the policy value by 40% if the loan is not otherwise

repaid.  This may be doubly devastating, since policy

loads are continuing to be taken out.

Finally, there is the issue of policy

management.  IULs are flexible

premium policies, which allows

policyholders to pay premiums or not, or

to pay premiums at a level of their

choosing.  The problem is that they do not always choose to pay premiums at

the level they should in order to properly support the policy, nor are they in a good position to

analyze the impact of a series of down years in the market and make any adjustments in their

premium accordingly.

As I see it, the purpose of the Bank On Yourself concept is to develop a secure financial floor

that grows in a steady, predictable manner. This gives you the wellspring of funds from which

other investments can be made.  The fixed premium of the whole life insurance contract imposes

a certain discipline on the policyholder; requiring the payment of premium in order to keep the

program in force.  (It also means that if the policyholder elects to have the premium paid by the

policy, the amount required to pay the premium is a fixed rather than an increasing amount.)

The IUL is much more like an investment. It

has the potential for higher returns, but it also

has the potential, if the returns are not there, that

the whole program will implode as the cash

values are depleted by cost of insurance, policy

loads, unexpectedly low interest rates, skipped

or sporadic payments, or unexpectedly high

loan interest rates (in comparison to the rate

credited to the policy).

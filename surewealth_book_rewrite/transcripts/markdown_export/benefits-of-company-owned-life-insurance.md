Dear Countdown Producers:

The October 7, 2009, airing of the “Countdown with Keith Olbermann” show included a

wildly erroneous segment focused on corporate-owned life insurance, commonly referred

to as COLI, as well as a direct attack on the National Association of Insurance and

Financial Advisors (NAIFA) and its political action committee, IFAPAC. I appreciate the

opportunity to educate your audience regarding NAIFA and IFAPAC and to correct the

misstatements about COLI. Although I don’t see the connection between the business

use of life insurance issue that Mr. Olbermann initiated and the current health care reform

debate taking place in Congress today, I’d like to address Mr. Olbermann’s seeming view

of NAIFA’s efforts to improve the healthcare and health insurance systems in this country.

For the record, NAIFA is an association of individual insurance agents and financial

advisors. NAIFA has no insurance company members. NAIFA members do not – and

cannot – set or manipulate prices, establish or raise premiums, or determine benefits

or coverage. Simply stated, NAIFA members work with their individual and business

clients to provide them competent and professional guidance so that they can make

informed choices about the vast array of insurance and financial products available in

the marketplace—including life and health insurance. Our members’ primary objective is

always to help their clients to achieve financial protection and security for their loved ones

and their employees.

Let me comment about healthcare reform first. Because NAIFA members work closely

with individual and business clients in local communities, and because they understand

that health insurance is at the foundation of a solid financial plan, NAIFA members are as

interested in making sure people have appropriate health insurance coverage as is the

person who needs that health insurance. For this reason, NAIFA supports legislation to

improve individual and business access to affordable health insurance for all Americans—

and has been far longer than most of the current members of Congress and current public

commentators.

Regarding COLI, Mr. Olbermann’s assertions on COLI are beyond factually incorrect; they

are distorted characterizations. Unless “Countdown with Keith Olbermann” is intentionally

produced as fiction, and not intended to be a credible source of opinion, news and

information, your viewers deserve clarification.

COLI is simply life insurance used by employers to protect against the financial cost of

losing a key employee, as well as to help provide funds for the payment of employee and

retiree benefits for potentially all employees of a firm, that is funded through life insurance

coverage on highly paid employees—not lower paid employees.

Congress has reaffirmed the benefits of COLI for more than two decades. Most recently

in 2006, Congress passed, and the President signed, the Pension Protection Act. This

legislation not only strengthened the nation’s pension system, but also codified COLI

best practices into federal law. The COLI provisions limit the placement of COLI contracts

on the lives of highly compensated employees and require the informed consent of the

insured individuals.

Specifically, the legislation, which had the support of a broad, bi-partisan majority in the

House and Senate:

Limits the coverage to officers, directors and “highly compensated employees” –

•

those in the top 35 percent by compensation.

Requires employers to obtain the informed consent of any employee before enrolling

•

him or her in a COLI plan, and to disclose the amount of coverage and that the policy

remains in force post-employment.

Requires employers to report annually information about their COLI plans to the Inter­

•

nal Revenue Service.

The Countdown report also included gross errors regarding the federal tax rules applicable

to business-owned life insurance. Interest paid on a loan used by a business to buy life

insurance is not deductible. Contrary to Mr. Olbermann’s report, tax law does not protect

life insurance owned by businesses from creditors in the event of a bankruptcy. Further, no

loan is subject to federal income tax. Only income is subject to income tax, so the fact that

a loan from life insurance is not taxable income is the usual rule, not an exception.

There are many business reasons for a company to own life insurance on its highly

compensated workers, and COLI policies, like all life insurance policies, must demonstrate

a clear insurable interest between the owner of the policy and the insured. Employers have

long been held to have an insurable interest in the lives of their employees. In fact, the

National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ (NAIC) guidelines provide that states

should recognize that employers have a lawful and substantial interest in the lives of their

employees. This guidance clearly demonstrates that state insurable interest laws are

followed when issuing COLI policies. Additionally, the federal government has the authority

to enforce the provisions contained in the Pension Protection Act, establishing multiple

layers of employee protection.

COLI policies provide employers with a predictable stream of future income vital to long-

term planning. Predictability is perhaps their most important feature. Businesses gain the

peace of mind that they will not have to close their doors or reduce employee benefits

following the death of key employees. COLI policies are not used for short term profits. In

fact, companies do not receive a tax deduction for the premiums paid on COLI policies.

COLI protects lines-of-credit, provides employers with business continuation and financial

assurance following the loss of a highly compensated talent, and allows them to plan for

the future and meet the benefit needs of today’s and tomorrow’s retirees.

In closing I suspect arguing the value and nature of political action committees, as legally

provided by Congress, with Mr. Olbermann is likely a fruitless effort. So I’m not going to do

it. But for the record, contributions to any of America’s more than 4,300 PACs (including

IFAPAC) are strictly limited by federal law and do not “buy politicians.”

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and for any efforts that can be made to correct

the errors presented during the October 7 segment. I offer any assistance I can provide.

Sincerely,

Tom Currey, CLU, ChFC, LUTCF

President, National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors

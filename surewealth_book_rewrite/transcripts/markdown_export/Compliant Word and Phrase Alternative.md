Account

This word is in common usage for bank or brokerage

accounts, and could mislead consumers into not being

fully aware that annuities or insurance are being discussed.

Annuity

Contract - for use with annuities Policy - for

use with Life or LTCi

Advice (advise/advisor)

Implies being qualified to have fee-based services, where

most insurance agents earn commissions instead of being

legally able to charge for their input. Utilizing variations of

this word could mislead consumers into believing they are

working with someone who is a Registered Investment

Advisor or another professional who is legally able to

charge for their consultations.

Can rest easy

An insurance product is not designed to promise a specific

emotional state. In relation to investing this is promissory as

it implies a lack of risk and suggests the client has little need

to be concerned with a product's performance. To avoid this

the focus should shift to the strategies designed to create

this intent.

Can recover loss

Insurance products are not designed to recover a client's

past realized losses. However, we can develop strategies

with our products that can help rebuild a client's assets.

This implies that there would normally be a charge.

Note - insurance agents cannot charge for meetings.

"comprehensive strategy"

Using this term implies a level of information and service that

is not provided in the context of FIAs. Note - there have been

cases where agents who have used comprehensive were

held to a greater responsibility to the client which they were

not able to fulfill. This pertains to cases where accident 8:/or

injury were not covered in the "comprehensive plan" when

this level of "service" had been listed. This term is often

used and acceptable with Long Term Care Insurance.

Contribution

This term is specific to money for a retirement plan, not an

annuity. Terminology should reflect the product, unless of

course the annuity is part of a retirement plan. To help

avoid confusion between actual retirement plans and

annuities it is best policy to avoid using this word.

Aim to create awareness of solutions, not to

evoke fear. Stay positive with the message by

Financial Planner

A financial planner is able to provide advice for a fee and

generally has achieved a designation, such as a CFP, or is

registered as an Investment Advisor, Series 65 licensed. An

agent is not licensed to provide planning advice for a fee,

therefore cannot be called a planner. In order to create a

more generic term that encompasses a broader number of

agents the term financial professional is appropriate.

Financial professional

Free

We are not able to refer to a service as free if there is inherent

cost or value. The SEC has ruled, and various state DOI

regulations have indicated to do so is untrue which is

deemed misleading since it gives the client a false

impression of the level of service they are being provided.

Instead the message to the client should be that the agent

is providing them with the appropriate level of service and

providing them with any perks they would not otherwise be

entitled to.

no obligation

Gain

The term "gain" implies positive market performance.

Since Fixed Index annuities are not investment products

and considered fixed products. In order to avoid confusion

of the product for securities, avoiding market related

terminology is advised.

Potential for indexed interest accumulation,

interest potential, accumulation, interest

Gain / Growth

We understand the confusion regarding using the word

"growth." It is common to want to show the benefits of

annuities, however, statements must be clear. Growth

should be used when speaking directly to interest earned.

We have made efforts to remove the term unless it is tied to

interest. Growth will be seen as inappropriate product

positioning. It implies use of securities language and may

cause FIA materials to be deemed as securities marketing

by regulators. We may not market our FIAs as a security in

any manner, if it appears that agents are doing so by using

fund /market terminology there will be increased scrutiny

as a result on all materials commonly associated with

these products.

Invest

This term risks giving the impression the client is entering

into a security. Since it is not possible to purchase shares in

an annuity it is not accurate to refer to the transaction as

investing. Instead it is more accurate to refer to the

interaction as purchasing the annuity.

Investments

Investments are securities and the term should not be used

products.

While annuities are designed to protect earnings they are

available without a surrender charge at any given time.

Volatile

This term should be used with caution as it is so closely tied

alternatives, but cannot be directly positioned as a way to

avoid market volatility. Also, the product itself is designed to

not have volatile value swings. In most cases volatile is not a

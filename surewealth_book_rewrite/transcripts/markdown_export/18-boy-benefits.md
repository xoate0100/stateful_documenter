That Bank On Yourself Gives You…

If Your Strategy Can Do What Bank On Yourself Can,

You Would Be The First – Let Me Know!

# Does Your Best Strategy Give You This Benefit?

Yes

No

I wish!

1

Your plan increases by a contractually guaranteed amount each year

2

Your principal doesn’t lose value when the stock or real estate markets crash

3

Your plan could be administered by a company so rock-solid, that it’s part of

one of the financially strongest financial services companies in the world

4

If the company that holds your account experiences financial results that are

better than their projected "worst-case" scenario, you may also receive a

dividend, in addition to your contractually guaranteed annual increase

(dividends are not guaranteed, however, the companies preferred by Bank

On Yourself Advisors have paid dividends every single year for at least 100

years, including during the Great Depression)

5

Once credited to your account, both your guaranteed annual increase and any

dividends you may have received are locked in – they don't vanish when the

stock or real estate markets tumble

6

You can have peace of mind knowing that your growth (as well as your

principal) in the plan are protected by a five-layer safety net

7

You don't have to depend on luck, skill, or guesswork in choosing the right

stock, mutual fund or other investment, and you can stop chasing after the

best way to invest money

8

If you pay for major purchases by borrowing your equity from your plan to

pay cash for these items, and then pay your plan back with interest (just as an

outside lender would have required you to do), you could ultimately

recapture most or all of the interest you'd otherwise pay to financial

institutions, and never see again

9

When you pay for things as described above, you can also get back every

penny you pay for them, over time!

10

Your plan comes with tax advantages. It's possible to get your hands on both

your principal and growth, with little or no tax consequences, under current

tax law. Dividends you leave in your plan are not taxable. And dividends you

take out of your plan are not taxed until they exceed the amount you put into

the plan (your "cost-basis"), at which point you could switch to borrowing

your "cash value" tax-free (as spelled out in IRS Tax Code, Section 72)

11

You are in control of the equity in your plan, and you don't have to sell or

liquidate your plan, investments or assets to get your hands on your equity

12

You can borrow your equity in the plan and use it to buy things or to invest

in anything you want, while your plan continues to grow as though you never

touched a dime of it. You can't be turned down for a loan (as long as you

have equity in the plan), and you don't have to fill out any nosy credit

applications. If an emergency comes up and you have to reduce or skip some

loan repayments, you won't get a black mark on your credit report or

harassing calls from bill collectors

13

You can predict the minimum guaranteed value of your plan in any given

year (less any outstanding loans you've taken from the plan), as well as the

minimum annual income you could take from the plan and for how long, so

you don't have to pin your hopes for a secure financial future on luck, skill,

or guessing games. (If the company that administers your plan has better

financial results than its worst-case predictions, you could have additional

growth.)

14

You can have access to your equity in the plan to provide retirement income

– when and how you want it – with no government penalties for "early"

withdrawal, or for waiting "too long." There are also no penalties for taking

out "too little" each year and no mandatory annual "minimum withdrawal"

requirements that are typical of traditional retirement plans (and without the

restrictions of 401k withdrawal rules)

15

Your plan has a guaranteed value at "maturity." If you pass on before then,

your family and/or favorite charities could receive a guaranteed and

predictable benefit many times larger than the current value of your plan.

And it could go to them income-tax free, according to current tax law (IRC

Section 101). What this means is that your loved ones could even get the

money you intended to save!

16

The money in your plan may be protected from creditors and lawsuits

(consult with legal counsel to determine what's applicable in your state)

17

Your plan is not dependent on government-sponsored programs like Social

Security or Medicare, both of which are predicted to go bankrupt. You also

don't need to depend on an employer to keep their pension or retirement plan

promises

18

You don’t have to be a tycoon to get started. The minimum amount required

to get started is very low, and there is no upper limit imposed by the

government (the upper limit is determined by your income and assets)

TOTALS:

NOTE1: The BOY concept uses companies that are in essence owned by policy owners, rather

than stockholders/investors, which allows the insurance company to focus on the long- term interests of

policy holders instead of the short-term demands of Wall Street.

NOTE2: You could lose some of these important advantages if your Bank On Yourself®

plan is from the wrong company, or if the wrong product is used, or if your plan is structured

incorrectly.  Fewer than one out of 1,000 financial advisors have the necessary knowledge

to implement this strategy properly, so be sure to work with a BOY Authorized Advisor® who

has access to the right companies and products, and knows how to structure the plan properly.

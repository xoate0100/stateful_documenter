If you could design the perfect financial instrument for growing your money throughout your

life, what attributes or characteristics would be important?

 Liquidity – immediate access to funds for emergency, opportunity, financing big-ticket

purchases, etc. with no restrictions or cost to access

 Safety – something that is highly rated by third-party rating services

 Guarantees on the Principal – so I can’t lose it to downside market risk

 Guarantees on the Growth – for at least a competitive long-term return that is predictable

 Tax-Deferred Accumulation – just like a qualified plan or annuity

 Untaxed Distribution – unlike a qualified plan or annuity

 No Contribution Limit – unlike qualified plans (IRA, 401k, etc.), there is no limit on how much

can be contributed per year

 No Distribution Limitations

 Flexibility

 Funding Continuation – in the event of disability

 Would avoid probate

 Would provide for a multiple of account value – at death to heirs

 Income Tax Free – to heirs at death

These attributes of a perfect financial instrument maximize efficiency, safety and control which

creates predictability and security for retirement.  If this type of financial product existed, how

much of your long term portfolio would you allocate toward it?

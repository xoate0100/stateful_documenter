Are You Asking Eough Questions?

The sales process for selling life insurance and annuities is one that easily

gets too complicated for your potential client, and they back out before you

even get a chance to show them your ideas on how you can help them. This

is mostly because there is a real lack of communication between you and

your potential client and that creates a gap in knowledge for you both.

Most people who meet with you have a list of questions that they will throw

at you, and that’s to be expected. But, what should also be a part of your

process is to ask them lots of questions, so you can understand their

motivations and their situation better.

Prospects expect to be asked the basic questions. What they don’t expect,

and what you need to ask, are questions about their lifestyle and personal

preferences. It’s important for you, as their advisor, to find out enough

information that tells you if they’re qualified buyers and a bit about their

expectations.

These questions can be broken into two types - emotional and fact gathering

questions - both categories require having plenty of questions in each that

can allow you to connect with your customer on a better level.

The objective of asking a question is to get them talking, to tell you how

they feel and what they really want. Once they tell you these things, then it's

simply a matter of giving them what they want.

You ask questions to show you are truly interested in finding out what they

want and then you ask more questions to clarify what they told you.

There is a knack to asking questions. It takes practice.

You need to practice intently listening to their answers and show a real

interest in their unique situation.

10 Major Blunders

That Most Advisors Make

#1. NOT ASKING ENOUGH QUESTIONS… You need to unearth the

needs and wants of your prospect BEFORE you talk about solutions.

#2. MAKING ASSUMPTIONS… Don’t assume anything. Ask and find out

and make double sure. You know how that old saying that goes…

#3. POOR LISTENING… You’re too busy thinking of what to say next, you

don’t listen.

#4. POOR TONALITY… It’s not what you say; it’s how you say it!

#5. TOO MUCH PRESSURE… No Hard Sales Tactics EVER!!!

#6. TALKING TOO MUCH… You’ve got 2 ears and 1 mouth, use them in

that proportion!

#7. NOT BUILDING YOUR VALUE… Why do they need to work with

you?

#8. CHEESY CLOSING LINES… You cannot use these with the today’s

modern buyer.

#9. WINGING IT… No Preparation and No planning beforehand!

#10. NEGATIVE MINDSET “If you think you can or cannot, you’re

probably right” Henry Ford.

The Power Of

Emotional Based Questions?

One of the main reasons so many agents and advisors struggle with getting

appointments and closing sales is they tend to lecture and tell prospects what

they should do. They tell the prospect that they have a problem and then they

try to provide the prospect with their solution to the prospect’s problem.

Doesn’t a salesperson telling a prospect what they should do create an

automatic response from that prospect… of immediate resistance?

Think about it.  Do you like to be told you have a problem?  Do you like to

be told what you should do?  Don’t you automatically fight the idea?  Aren’t

you immediately skeptical? Wouldn’t you rather identify your own problems

and come up with your own solutions?

For example, when most agents and advisors are talking to retirees they

assume that if the prospect has a CD, then they are unhappy with the interest

rate they are getting…  So they might ask: “Do you have money in CD’s?”

If the client says yes, then the agent jumps in and says: “I can show you how

you can get a much better return.”  The agent or advisor goes on to tell the

prospect about a great new product or idea they have to make them more

money. The prospect automatically says: “Let me think about it!”

Why? Because no one likes to be sold!

The Top Producers have learned how to get more appointments and close

more sales by helping prospects identify their own problems and then

helping them come up with their own solutions… They have learned how to

help prospects to sell themselves. And that involves asking enough of the

right questions…

Agent: “Mr. Prospect, if you don’t mind me asking, do you have any of your

money in CDs?”

Prospect: “Yes.”

Agent: “Are you happy with the interest rate you’re getting?”

Prospect: “It could be better. But it’s Ok. I like the safety an guarantees. And

I can get at the money when I need it.”

# Page 6

Agent: “If you don’t mind me asking, are you using that money for an

income?”

Prospect: “Yes.”

Agent: “Are you using any of the principal?”

Prospect: “Yes!”

Agent: “How do you feel about that?”

Prospect: “It’s a problem, we’re afraid we won’t have enough money.”

Agent: “Does your current income allow you to do everything you’d like to

do?”

Prospect: “No, it would be better if I had more income?”

Agent: “If you had more income what would you like to do?”

Prospect: “I like to visit more with my grandchildren.”

Agent: “If we could come up with a way to get the income you need, so you

can visit you’re grandchildren, without digging into the principal and have

the same safety and guarantees as a CD, would that be better for you? ”

Prospect: “Can you do that?”

Agent: “From what I see here I think with you and I working together we

can do it.”

Can you see the difference? We’ve helped the prospect to identify their

problems and we are working with the prospect to help them come up with

their own solutions.

Is there any question that you will have a much better chance of getting the

prospect to move their money to you? Isn’t the prospect in fact selling them

self?

Remember, no one likes to be sold!  If you learn to help the prospect to

identify their own problems and then help them find their own solutions,

you’ll get more appointments and you’ll close more sales… And, in many

cases it’ll be a much, much larger sale!

“When was the last time you ‘Listened’ yourself out of a sale?”

Pre Qualifying Power Questions

For Setting Appointments

One of the things that most advisors miss is the first sale they must make to

their prospect!  It’s selling the need for an appointment!

You must ask questions to help them see they have a problem. Then you

must help them see that you have the solution!

Ask the following:

If there were a way to increase the yield on the money you have in the bank

by 40% or more, would you like to know how?

If I could show you how to recoup your stock market loses by participating

in the upside of the stock market, without the risk of the downside, and both

your principle and interest are 100% guaranteed, would it be worth 20

minutes of your time?

If there were a way to stop paying income taxes on your interest earnings,

would you like to know how?

If there were a way to reduce or eliminate the income taxes on your social

security income, would you like to know how?

If there were a way to guarantee a lifetime income for you and your spouse,

would you like to know how?

If there were a way to protect your capital, for your spouse, children and

grandchildren, would you like to know how?

If there were a way to avoid probate and court costs, would you like to know

how?

Would you like more income, more growth, less taxes, more money for your

spouse, children, and grandchildren?

If I could show you how to set up a savings plan that will provide significant

additional wealth for you in retirement - tax free, would it be worth 20

minutes of your time?

Sample Fact Finding Probing Questions

Here is a quick idea of the fact-finding questions I ask....

For example for seniors - in the 'employment area' of the fact finder I would

put down they are retired, and then I would get a break down of their

income. – Social Security, pensions, interest, IRA distributions, etc.

Then depending what they have for income, I would ask – "How much of

that income are you using each month?"

If they have excess income – "What are you doing with the excess? How do

you feel about that? Why did you choose that particular investment? What

kind of return are you getting on that investment?"

"How much are you paying in quarterly income taxes? How do you feel

about paying income taxes on the income you're not using?"

If there isn't excess income – "Is that income comfortable? Does it allow

you to do the things you'd like to do? What would you like to do? How much

income would you need to do that?"

If they're digging into their principle – "How do they feel about that? Are

you concerned you're going to run out of money?"

If they have a pension – "Does your spouse get your pension if you die?"

"How do you feel about that?"

The object is to get them talking to tell you how they feel and what they

really want. Once they tell you these things, then it's simply a matter of

giving them what they want.

Notice, I'm not using my questions to try to lead them to my products.

I'm truly interested in finding out what they want and then asking clarifying

questions.

There is a knack to asking questions, but all it takes is practice, intent

listening to their answers and a real interest in their unique situation.

By the way I always try to include some simple free advice that is not related

to anything I do. Example: I always ask if they have a will (or trust), a

living will and a power of attorney. Why not? And, we briefly discuss their

importance.

accumulated or the amount of money you get to spend?”

“Do you think social security will be there when you retire?”

“Even if it’s there, do you think it will provide as much for retirees as it

provides today?”

“If Social Security isn’t there what will happen?”

“How do you feel about that?”

Your prospect says: “I’ll never retire!”…  “

Why do you say that?” “Is that how you really feel?”

“Is that because you feel you’ll never save enough for retirement?”

“If I could show you how to have the retirement you want without

sacrificing your current life style would you like to know how?”

Questions… Seminars, Setting

Appointments and Fact-Finding

If you want to get the prospect emotionally involved, you must ask

questions…

These are just some of the questions your associates are asking to get a 90%

appointment rate from their seminars and a 90% closing rates for their sales

appointments!

#1 CDs

How many of you own CDs?  PAUSE

How many of you are happy with the returns?  PAUSE

If you have $100,000 CD… and you're lucky to be getting 2% return, then

you’re making $2,000 on that…RIGHT?   PAUSE

If you're in a 25% tax bracket you are probably netting around 1.5%…

PAUSE

If you could get a 4% return instead of a 2% return…in the same tax bracket

you end up with 3% right?  PAUSE

Which is double or 100% more income for you… right?   PAUSE

What would an additional $1,500 mean to you this year? PAUSE

What could you do with that money? PAUSE

For example, would like to visit your grandchildren? Take a cruise…?

PAUSE

#2 Stocks & Mutual Funds

How many of you have lost money in the market during the last 10 years?

PAUSE

How many of you are back to where you were 10 years ago? PAUSE

# Page 14

14

Last year we had a pretty good year in the market.  Hopefully it will keep

going up.  But what happens if it goes down…again?  PAUSE

How much more money are you willing to lose? PAUSE

How is that going to affect your income? PAUSE

How much would it affect your income if the market dips for a couple of

years?  PAUSE

Let me ask you, if you could lock in current returns and position yourself so

you could not lose any more money… but you could still reap the upside of

the stock market… How much better off would you be? PAUSE

What would that mean to your income? PAUSE

If there were no possibility of losing, what would that mean to you? PAUSE

How much more comfortable would you feel?  PAUSE

"Mr. Prospect, you told me you have lost money in the stock market, right?

If you don't take action today and the market declines again, how much more

are you willing to lose?" PAUSE

#3 Money Management

How many of you would like to know how to make money in today's

market? PAUSE

If you could position your money so you could minimize your losses would

that appeal to you?  PAUSE

If you have $100,000 in Mutual Funds and you lose $50,000 that's a 50%

loss, right?

Think about it…what kind of return do you have to have to get back to the

starting amount of $100,000?  PAUSE

You would have to make $50,000 to get back to a $100,000. That's a 100%

return you would have to make almost 100%...right?  PAUSE

And that's just to get back to even. If you are taking income from that

money, it's even worst…isn't it?  PAUSE

# Page 15

15

#4 Income taxes

How many of you are paying taxes on your social security?  PAUSE

If you are being taxed on 85% of your social security…and you're making

$15,000 a year for both of you, then your being taxed on $13,000 of your

social security income!

Doesn't that mean that if you're in a 28% tax bracket… you're paying almost

$4,000 in unnecessary income taxes?  PAUSE

What could you do with an extra $4,000 a year? PAUSE

New car?  Home Repairs?  More travel?  PAUSE

What if you could position your money so that you didn't have to pay taxes

on your social security? PAUSE

How much better off would you be? PAUSE

How do you feel about that? PAUSE

#5 Living Trust

How many of you have gone through probate recently?  PAUSE

How big a hassle was it? PAUSE

How many times did you have to visit the attorney? PAUSE

How much did you lose to the attorney? PAUSE

How long did it take to get your money? PAUSE

#6 Mortgage Protection

“By the way, if you don't mind me asking,”

“Do you currently have a mortgage on your home?”

“Do you have a mortgage life insurance policy to pay off your home for

your family if something happens to you or your spouse?”

“Is there any particular reason why you don't have mortgage protection?”

# Page 16

16

“How do you feel about that?”

“If something happen to you or your spouse tomorrow would you or your

spouse be able to keep the home?”

“How do you feel about that?”

“Do you feel that having a mortgage protection policy is important?”

“If I could show you how to get the insurance you need to pay off your

mortgage and protect your family without taking any additional money out

of your pocket or changing your life style would you like to know how?”

#7 Disability Income

“Mr. Prospect if you fell off a ladder fixing your home, or got into a car

accident and your family lost your income for six months or a year, what

would happen?”

“I’ve never thought about it, but we would probably have to dig into

our saving.”

“How do you feel about that?”

“I wouldn’t be happy.”

“How long would your savings last?”

“Probably about 3 months.”

“Then what would your family do?”

“I don’t know.”

“If I could show you how to get the insurance you need to replace your

income for your family, without taking any additional money out of your

pocket or changing your life style would you like to know how?”

More Fact-finding Questions

Use these questions to set appointments or when you meet people for the

first appointment.

Ask questions to help prospects recognize a problem they have... And

then you can help them find a solution.

Do you have a professional, that you trust, who assists in your financial

matters and keeps you informed about new opportunities?

Yes! If I may ask, when was the last time you met face to face with your

advisor? How have you been faring with you investments in recent years?

How do you feel about that?

Is your advisor just concerned with your investments?

Have they ever discussed how to reduce your taxes or how to eliminate your

consumer debt? ...Protecting your family, cost savings ideas,

How much you need and want for retirement etc.? How do you feel about

that? Discussion...

No! Would you agree there are a lot of changes happening everyday in the

financial industry?

Are you like most of my clients and have trouble keeping abreast of all the

changes?

How do you feel about that? As a professional in financial services, I try to

keep up to date on these changes so I can help my clients make intelligent

long range decisions. I am applying for the job as your personal financial

professional. Discussion...

Do you have a personal or company sponsored retirement plan...

Yes! Great! I congratulate you. Too many of the people I see have not even

started a plan.

What kind of retirement plan do you have? Do you have any investment

options in the plan?

How have you been selecting which investments to use?

# Page 18

Have you looked at the new Roth IRA?

How have you been faring with you investments in recent years?

Discussion...

No! Oh! Is there any particular reason why you haven’t started an IRA or a

non regulated private pension plan?

How do you feel about that?  Discussion!

“Are you maximizing your contributions to your 401k / IRA / Sep?”

Yes! Great! How much are you currently putting away? How have they been

doing? How do you feel about that? Discussion...

No! Is there any particular reason why you are not maximizing your

contributions? How do you feel about that? Discussion...

“Do you think Social Security will be there when you retire?”

Yes! You may be right. However, I am not sure that it will be the same, as it

is now.

Do you know what your normal retirement age is now under SS?

Most of my clients are unaware that they can't get full SS benefits at age 65.

They have already moved up the normal retirement to age 67, for some

people, and they are talking about moving it up to age 70.

I’m concerned that the amount of benefits is going to be reduced for most

people once the baby boomers start retiring.

How do you feel about that? Discussion...

No! You may be right.... They’ve already moved up the normal retirement to

age 67, for some people, and they are talking about moving it up to age 70.

Yes! Has anyone taken the time to help you calculate what you are going to

need at retirement?

How do you feel about that? We can evaluate your current program and then

calculate the additional amounts (if any) that you’ll need to save each month,

to have the income you’ll need at retirement. Does that make sense?

No! Why, do you say that? Has anyone taken the time to help you calculate

what you are going to need at retirement? How do you feel about that?

A Smart Money Move

…Wisely Using Your Home Equity!

“Yes, you can become a millionaire – even a multimillionaire - and the

greatest catapult is probably sitting right under your own roof! …the key to

enhancing your net worth is managing the equity in your home…”

Douglass R. Andrew, author of ‘Missed Fortune’

Isn’t one of our jobs as advisors to help our prospects and clients to

manage their assets better, to get the most benefits out of what they

have?

One of the best ways, to help your prospects, is to show them the

benefits they can enjoy through strategically managing the tax savings

and equity growth of their home.

The quickest and easiest way for me to explain these concepts is to role-

play it the exact way I do it with prospects…

Agent: If you don’t mind me asking, about how much equity do you have in

your home?

Prospect: $40,000.

Agent: Let me ask you, if you leave the $40,000 of equity in your home or

take it out, will it change how much your home appreciates in value?

Prospect: No, it will appreciate the same.

Agent: If that’s the case, then what’s happening to that $40,000 of equity?

Prospect: Nothing, it’s just sitting there.

Agent: From a financial or business perspective, does that make any sense?

Prospect: No, I guess it doesn’t.

Agent: Let me ask you, if you were to refinance your home today, to get that

equity out, what could you get for a loan rate?

# Page 21

21

Prospect: Probably about 5%.

Agent: Would you agree that the interest on your home is tax deductible?

Prospect: Yes.

Agent: Then if you are in a 28% percent tax bracket, isn’t your actual after

tax cost about 3.5%?

Prospect: Yes.

Agent: If you had $40,000 in you hands right now and you invested it, what

do you think you could get for a rate of return?

Prospect: About 7% or 8%.

Agent: If that’s the case. If you can borrow money at a net 3.5% and invest

it and make 7%, does it make any sense to leave it there?

Prospect: No, it doesn’t. I never thought about it like that.

Agent: Let’s think for a minute. If you borrow out the $40,000 and invest it

at 7%. That means the $40,000 would grow to $80,000 in 10 years…

$160,000 in 20 years… and $320,000 in 30 years… How much better off

are you!

(Based on the rule of 72)

Prospect: A lot better off.

Agent: Let’s go one step further. If I may ask, do you have any credit card

debt?

Prospect: Yes.

Agent: If you don’t mind me asking, what interest rate are you paying on

those credit cards?

Prospect: About 18%.

Agent: If you can borrow money at 3.5%, does it make any sense to be

paying 18%?

Prospect: No, it doesn’t.

# Page 22

22

Agent: Do you have any other loans?

Prospect: Yes, a car loan.

Agent: What’s the interest on that?

Prospect: I think it’s about 8%.

Agent: Again, if you can borrow money at 3.5%, does it make any sense to

be paying 8%?

Prospect: No, it doesn’t.

Agent: If we borrowed the $40,000 of equity from your home and paid off

all your loans, what would that save you per month?

Prospect: It would save me about $500 per month.

Agent: If you invested the $500 per month for the next 10 years, wouldn’t

you have $500 times

12 months, which is $6,000, times 10 years which is over $60,000 and that

doesn’t count the interest on that money. How much better off would you

be?  (In 10 years at 7% the prospect would actually have $87,000)

Prospect: Much better off.

Agent: Imagine for a moment that you have $60,000 sitting in an

investment. Now you want to buy a car. Instead of borrowing from the bank,

you borrow the money from yourself and you pay yourself back the same

interest you would have paid the bank. How much better off are you?

Prospect: A lot better off.

Agent: Does this make sense to you? Would you like me workout the actual

numbers for your situation?

Prospect: Yes….

How much have you helped your prospect?

Important Note: By law you cannot recommend putting the home equity at

risk into the stock market – you can’t put the home equity at risk into mutual

funds or variable products….

Asking Enough Questions Is The Key

To Your Ultimate Success!

Unfortunately, one of the most important, least learned and least practiced

insurance sales skills today, is asking questions. Yet it is the key to

conducting a good, thorough fact-finding interview… and the key to your

sale.

A good, thorough fact-find is much more than asking some simple questions

to identify a few pertinent facts and concerns, so that you can make a quick

sale. It's asking the tough emotional questions to guide your prospect to self-

discovery of their own financial concerns and problems. It's helping your

prospect to get emotionally involved in the entire sales process. It's helping

them feel the real pain of their current situation, so they want to do

something about it, right now, to alleviate that pain.

Consider people don't always do or buy what they need. Logically, we may

know we need to lose weight, quit smoking, save for retirement or pay off

our credit cards. But, do we do it? NO! We put it off until we have no other

choice, because it's causing us unbearable pain. Only when the pain becomes

too great to live with, will we decide to do something about it.

However, the art of asking enough questions goes far beyond asking

questions to guide people to self-discovery of their own financial concerns,

there's an even deeper reason. It is being genuinely engaged in asking - and

listening beyond a sale motive - to take the conversation, and the

relationship, to another place. You become their partner in solving their

problems, because you cared enough to ask questions beyond the obvious.

You cared enough to ask, and did not assume that financial security means

Infinite Banking

Institute

Comparing Whole Life versus

Universal

Robert P. Murphy, PhD

In both the Lara-Murphy Report and our book,

How Privatized Banking Really Works, Carlos and I

explain the benefits of Nelson Nash’s Infinite Banking

Concept (IBC), which involves the disciplined use of

dividend-paying life insurance policies. Since Nash

himself couches the discussion in terms of whole life

policies, we naturally did the same.

However, there are other categories of permanent

life insurance policies that have “cash value” besides

whole life, and people often ask us what the difference

is. In the present article I’ll sketch the comparison

between whole life (WL) and universal life (UL)

policies.

The Origin of Universal Life

Subscribers to the Lara-Murphy Report will

remember Carlos’ article from the April 2012 issue, in

which he laid out the history of the scathing 1979 FTC

report on whole life. One of the major complaints was

the lack of transparency, with consumer advocates

claiming that policyholders had little understanding

of how their contracts worked and what returns they

were earning on their money. In short, the claim

was that a typical WL policy was a black box, with

various and hidden expenses taken out from the gross

premium payments, leaving less available to build up

as cash value.

To combat this alleged lack of transparency,

insurers offered UL policies which were designed

to “open up the hood” on permanent life insurance

contracts. In any given period, the charges (such as

mortality) assessed on a UL policy are explicitly and

contractually specified, so that the policyholder can

(in theory) understand exactly what happened to his

gross premium payment.

In addition to breaking up the components of a

standard WL policy into separate categories, the

UL policy offered more flexibility—hence the

name “universal.” Rather than paying a fixed, level

premium as with a WL policy, the UL policy allows

the owner discretion to contribute whatever amount

he wants. When cash flow is tight, the policyholder

can contribute less, making up the difference when

things are better.

Because of the apparent benefits of greater

transparency and flexibility, as well as the ability to

benefit more immediately from unusually high interest

rates, there was a large shift in the insurance industry

away from WL and into UL policies during the early

1980s. In 1979 WL policies accounted for about 85%

of new premiums sold, but by 1986 the figure had

dropped to about 50%. The drop was almost entirely

accounted for by the rise of UL.1

Equivalent…in Theory

Perhaps ironically, from a theoretical accounting

standpoint, WL and UL policies are actually quite

similar. Indeed in the May 2012 issue of the LMR,

in my article on guaranteed interest rates, I showed a

table where the (gross) level premium on a WL policy

had mortality expenses deducted each year based on

the mortality rate and the Net Amount at Risk (NAR).

After the mortality expense had been deducted, the

# Page 2

david@infinitebanking.org

balance of the premium went into the cash value of

the policy, where it grew at the guaranteed interest

rate.

To repeat, in my article I was discussing whole life

policies, even though the actual contracts for such

policies don’t promise the policyholder a detailed

breakdown year by year of the mortality charges

and other deductions out of the gross premium.

Instead, the WL contract merely shows what the level

premium payments will be, along with the string of

guaranteed cash values and death benefit available at

various future dates. But this parsimonious display

hides the fact that behind the scenes the insurance

company is running the same calculations that appear

more explicitly in UL contracts, in order to properly

price its WL contracts.

Here is another way of seeing the theoretical

equivalence between WL and UL: If someone has

a UL policy set to the same death benefit, and with

the same interest rate and mortality parameters, then

by choosing to make the same premium payments as

would apply to a comparable WL policy, the behavior

of the UL policy would mimic the WL policy. Indeed,

this is why some people argue that it is smarter to use

UL policies even for privatized banking purposes,

since a UL policy can always do the same as a WL

policy, but it also carries more options.

In other words, the fans of UL are claiming that

flexibility is inherently a good thing, and that the

worst that can happen is a policyholder will elect not

to take advantage of this freedom and will instead

behave exactly as if he had taken out a WL policy.

Different…in Practice

Despite the claims of its advocates, however,

there are fierce critics of UL policies. For one thing,

continued tweaking of their structure has resulted in

a situation where now the allegedly transparent UL

policy is arguably more confusing to the customer

than a traditional WL policy.

A much more serious problem is that a policyholder

can unwittingly eat away at the UL’s cash value by

underfunding it. Remember that there is no fixed

premium payment that the policyholder must make.

In a given period, if the contribution is less than the

mortality and other expenses assessed on the policy,

the cash value will go down. Nelson Nash writes:

Universal Life was invented in the early 1980s

by E.F. Hutton, a stock brokerage firm that, in my

opinion, knew nothing about life insurance….

This happened during a time of high interest

rates and it “looked good” in the early years of

the policy. When I first saw the policy I ran some

illustrations and they kept “falling apart” when

the insured attained age 65 to 70. The cost of one-

year term became prohibitive at the advanced

ages and “ate up the cash fund” from that point

forward. Therefore, I never sold one of them when

I was in the business—and I surely wouldn’t buy

one!2

To understand the potential dangers of UL policies,

consider: Many people in the early 1980s switched

out of WL policies and into ULs, because agents

showed them that in the high interest rate environment

of the time, one could achieve the same death benefit

coverage on a UL policy with a lower premium

contribution than was necessary on a WL policy.

The problem is that when interest rates declined,

some of these policyholders failed to increase their

premium payments. Not realizing that these “free

lunches” from the policy switch were a temporary

phenomenon, these unsuspecting policyholders were

eating away at their wealth. There are horror stories

of people sending payments on UL policies to the

insurers for decades, only to receive a letter informing

them of huge amounts owed just to keep the policies

from collapsing.

Now it’s true, there are comparable dangers with

a WL policy. The way to mimic underfunding of a

UL policy, would be to pay the level premium (as

contractually required) but then to borrow most of it

right back. Depending on the relationship between the

policy loan interest rate and the dividends paid on the

WL policy, the insurer might send a similar notice to

the owner, explaining that at least some of the interest

on the loans would have to be paid, to keep the WL

policy in force.

Naturally, such irresponsible borrowing isn’t what

Nelson Nash advocates—he tells his fans to “not steal

the peas” and pay back policy loans on a systematic

basis. Even so, my point is that one can get into

trouble with a WL policy as well as with a UL policy,

through excessive borrowing and failing to pay back

the policy loans. This is the WL analog of someone

who underfunds a UL policy. Yet notice that it takes

a much more conscious decision to borrow against a

WL policy, rather than the much more understandable

mistake of (say) making the same premium payments

on a UL policy, even though portfolio returns don’t

live up to expectations when the UL policy was first

taken out.

Policy Loans in WL vs. UL

On the issue of policy loans, there is a formal

distinction between the two classes that is actually

not as significant in practice. When someone takes out

a policy loan with a WL policy, the money does not

“come out of the policy.” Rather, the insurer lends the

money as a distinct transaction, with the cash value of

the WL policy merely serving as the collateral on the

loan. The WL policy itself continues to operate just

as before, with the only difference stemming from

the policy loan being lower dividend payments, if the

insurer practices direct recognition.

In contrast, taking out money from a UL policy

is like making a negative premium contribution. It

effectively withdraws the funds out of the available

cash value, so that there is a lower total rolling over

at the credited interest rate. (Note: Actually this

difference is not as serious as one might think. What

often happens is that the insurance company will

credit a lower—but not a zero—interest rate to the

cash value in a UL policy that is “spoken for” by an

outstanding policy loan. In this arrangement, the UL

policy loan is very similar to a WL policy loan under

direct recognition.)

Although these formal treatments may be different,

in practice the impact on the policyholder is largely

the same. It’s true that borrowing money against a UL

policy leaves less available to grow at the baseline

interest rate. However, the upside is that there is no

policy loan growing exponentially, either. In other

words, even though the WL policy (under non-direct

recognition) grows more quickly when a loan is taken

against it, the net cash value available—determined

by subtracting the total amount due on the policy

loan—is the right figure to consider, for an apples to

apples comparison of the two methods.

Equity Exposure Means More Risk

In addition to a plain vanilla UL policy, there are

also variants that seek to capture exposure to stock

market gains. An equity indexed universal life (EIUL)

policy has built-in floors, just like a WL policy, but it

also promises to rise (albeit in a muted fashion) with

the stock market.

Some analysts look at historical returns and conclude

that EIULs provide more wealth in retirement years

than a traditional WL policy. There are many pitfalls

when making such comparisons, but one of the most

obvious is that it ignores risk. After all, over long

stretches the equity markets tend to outperform fixed

income assets. Yet this greater expected rate of return

compensates for the greater volatility.

In other words, it would be silly for someone to

say, “Nobody should ever buy bonds, because stocks

or real estate historically earn higher returns.” This

is because people often want to keep some of their

wealth in very safe assets, which won’t drop 40 percent

in a year the way the S&P 500 did during the recent

crisis. By the same token, then, one can’t dismiss WL

policies merely because EIULs exhibited a greater

rate of return over some historical period.

Todd Langford has published a scathing critique

of EIUL policies.3  One of his subtle points is that

when the “side fund” goes down because of a drop

in the stock market, the policyholder is hit with a

double whammy. Not only does the side fund lose

value, but now the pure term insurance component

carries a higher mortality expense. This is because the

insurance company—in order to cover itself vis-à-

vis the face death benefit on the EIUL policy—has to

effectively take out a one-year term insurance policy

on the insured, with a death benefit equal to the “Net

The Simplicity of Sound Money

by Patrick Barron

Understanding today’s convoluted domestic and

international fiat monetary system frankly requires

a great deal of time and study. One must understand

fractional reserve banking, and the way this system

affects the money supply. One must understand the

multi-step process by which banks create money out

of thin air.

One must understand central bank open market

operations. Internationally, one must try to understand

floating exchange rates, how they are manipulated by

central banks, and the resulting impact on national

economies. For example, is it best for a country to

drive down its exchange rate in relation to other

currencies or do the opposite?

These issues are never understood by policymakers,

who appear to be among the most illiterate in

economic matters, so monetary policy swings to-

and-fro according to which economic group has

temporary control over the levers of the government,

and particularly of central banks.

So Simple Even a Child Can Understand It

In a sound money environment, on the other

hand, there is little confusion or controversy. Under

sound money—in which money is a commodity (for

discussion purposes let us assume it to be gold)—

everyone, to some extent, understands monetary

theory. Whether it be an individual, a family, a

corporation, or a nation, either one has money or one

does not. It really is as simple as that. Even children

learn the nature of money. A child quickly learns that

the things he wants cost money and either he has it

or he does not. If he does not, he quickly grasps that

there are ways to get it. He can ask his parents for an

increase in his allowance. Or, he can earn the money

he needs by doing chores around the house or for

friends and neighbors. He might be able to borrow

the money for large purchases, promising to pay back

his parents either from his future allowance or from

anticipated future earnings from doing extra chores.

His parents can evaluate this loan request simply by

Amount at Risk,” namely the face death benefit on

the EIUL policy minus the market value of the side

fund at that moment. Thus, when the side fund drops

in value, the size of the implicit term insurance policy

is bigger, and hence the EIUL policy’s value absorbs

a larger mortality expense.

Conclusion

Whole life policies are surprisingly complex

creatures, where the contractually specified premium

and projected cash values are derived from a host of

calculations that remain hidden to the policyholder.

In order to promote transparency, and facilitate

comparisons with other financial products, universal

life came on the scene in the early 1980s and quickly

captured a large share of the market.

Theoretically, WL and UL policies can achieve

similar results with the appropriate actions of the

policyholder. However, a person can put a WL policy

in a drawer and forget about it; the level premiums

were designed to allow the policy to hit its cash value

milestones year after year. In contrast, insufficient

oversight can lead to a gutted UL policy; the risk

of an underperforming portfolio is effectively on

the policyholder. It is for this reason that we warn

neophytes not to use UL policies for privatized

banking purposes, since the “safety is off” as it were.

From our vantage point, it is much safer to steer

people into traditional WL policies, which can always

be customized with various riders to satisfy financial

objectives on a case by case basis.

considering the likelihood that his allowance and

chore income are sufficient.

How is this any different when applied to adults,

companies, or governments? In a sound money

environment, they are the same. Individuals earn

what they spend on the family and may borrow from

the bank to buy a home or a new car. The lender will

examine whether the person’s income is sufficient to

pay back the loan. If the family hits hard times, they

may ask for assistance from relatives or a charity.

Companies have more means with which to fund their

operations. Stockholders provide the company with

its initial capital. Thereafter, when normal earnings

are insufficient to fund desired expansion, the

company can borrow against accounts receivables and

inventories, both of which provide varying degrees of

security for the lender.

So Simple Even a Politician Can Understand It

A national government’s finances, under a sound

money system, are little different from either a

household’s or a company’s. It needs to collect in taxes

what it spends. If it suffers a budget deficit, it can cut

back spending, attempt to raise taxes, or borrow in the

open market. In a sound money environment, there is

a limit to the amount of debt that even a government

can incur, due to the need to pay back the loan from

future tax revenue. If the market believes that this

may not be forthcoming, the nation’s credit rating

may suffer and its borrowing costs will rise, perhaps

to the point that the nation is completely shut out of

the credit market. But this is a good thing! The market

instills practical discipline that even a politician can

understand! Under sound money, one does not need a

special education to understand the monetary system.

Taking the process one step further, anyone can

understand international monetary theory in a sound

money environment. The national currency is simply

shorthand for a quantity of gold. A US dollar may be

defined as one thirty-fifth of an ounce of gold, and a

British pound defined as roughly one seventh of an

ounce of gold. Exchange rates become mathematical

ratios that do not vary. So an American purchasing

English goods would exchange his dollars for pounds

at a ratio of five dollars per British pound; i.e., one

seventh of an ounce of gold (a pound) divided by one

thirty-fifth of an ounce of gold (a dollar) equals five

dollars to a pound. Through the banking system, the

English exporter would demand gold from the issuer

of dollars, whether it be from a central bank or private

bank, at thirty-five dollars per ounce. When a currency

is simply a substitute for gold, either the issuer has

gold with which to redeem its currency or it does not.

Money Issuers Subject to Normal Commercial

and Criminal Law

When a nation overspends internationally, its

gold reserves start to dwindle. Money, which is

backed one hundred percent by gold, becomes scarce

domestically. Domestic prices fall, triggering a rise in

foreign demand for the nation’s goods. The process

of gold depletion is halted and then reversed. This

is the classical “Currency School” of international

monetary theory. Commercial banks present checks

drawn on one another every day and the same process

would exist for gold-backed currencies. If a bank

issues more scrip than it can redeem for gold at the

promised price, it is guilty of fraud. Its officers and

directors can be sued in court for any loss incurred by

those who accepted the bank’s scrip. Furthermore, the

officers and director could be prosecuted for the crime

of fraud. In other words, banking would be subject

to normal commercial laws and bank officers and

directors would be subject to normal criminal laws.

Good Money Drives Out Bad

The free market monetary system would drive bad

money issuers out of the market. Plus, bad money

issuers would suffer the loss of both their personal

finances and, in the case of outright fraud, loss of their

personal freedom. This would be a sobering incentive

to deter criminals and attract only legitimate money

issuers. Money would be a bailment; i.e., property

held for the benefit of another, which must be

surrendered upon demand for redemption. All around

us exist analogous bailment examples of entrusting

valuable goods to complete strangers. We leave our

cars with valets at parking garages, our clothing at

neighborhood cleaners, our overcoats at coat checks,

# Page 6

our luggage to the airlines, valuable merchandise

with shippers. In these cases, we fully expect that our

property will be returned to us. And it almost always

is! If it is not, public trust in the fraudulent outfits

evaporates, and they quickly go out of business.

Likewise, money issuers would thrive only when

the public trusts their integrity, which would be

enhanced by regular outside audits by respected firms

of the existence of one-hundred-percent reserves to

back the money issuer’s scrip. How different this

would be from our present system in which the Fed

will not allow an audit of its gold reserves even

when held for the benefit of other central banks! It

is clear that in a free market monetary system such a

policy would drive Federal Reserve Notes out of the

market through lack of demand. Even were the Fed

to back its notes with its gold reserves, in a totally

free market in which private banks could issue their

own gold-backed scrip, the Fed would suffer from

its past history of blatant money debasement and

secrecy in its operations. The market would prefer the

money issued by a well-respected private bank whose

operations are transparent and subject to outside audit

by respected accounting firms.

Conclusion

In a sound money environment everyone

understands monetary theory. Money is like any other

desired commodity, except it is not consumed. It is a

medium of indirect exchange, which traders accept in

order to exchange for something else at a later time.

This is easily understood, whether the trader is a

child, a parent, a company, or a nation. One either has

money or one does not. The money can be a money

substitute, a bailment, with which one can demand the

redemption of the real money—gold. Money issuers

must keep one-hundred-percent reserves against

their money substitutes in order to abide by normal

commercial and criminal law. No special agencies or

monetary authorities are necessary to make the system

work. The system emerges naturally and is regulated

via the normal commercial and criminal legal system.

This is the system that government does not want

us to have, because it provides no special favors for

enhancing state power. Sound money shackles the

government to the will of the people and not vice

versa. As Ludwig von Mises stated in The Theory of

Money and Credit:

It is impossible to grasp the meaning of the idea

of sound money if one does not realize that it was

devised as an instrument for the protection of civil

liberties against despotic inroads on the part of

governments. Ideologically it belongs in the same

class with political constitutions and bills of rights.

Deposit Taxes: Should We

Prepare?

by Doug French

There's no way it could happen in the United

States. That's the conventional wisdom on this side

of the pond about the ECB's bailout of the banks in

Cyprus. That caper looks as if it may take a chunk out

of the hides of at least some bank depositors on the

tiny Mediterranean island.

So far, the Cyprus parliament can't pull the trigger

on a plan to tax insured and uninsured bank deposits

to pay a share of the bailout. However, a bank holiday

has been declared and Cypriot depositors are nervous,

taking all they can from ATMs. The Cypriot banks,

loaded with Greek debt, are on the verge of collapse.

William Isaac, a former chairman of the FDIC,

calls the idea of taxing insured deposits in the U.S.

"unthinkable." He went on to tell American Banker,

"I can't believe the Europeans were that insensitive to

the psychology of depositors throughout the world.

They have a government pledge to cover these people,

and they've reneged on it."

At the same time, Isaac says governments have a

right to give a "haircut" to (aka steal from) uninsured

depositors. He adds, "But I would question in light of

the worldwide financial instability over the past five

years whether this is the right time to make that move,

particularly without any notice."

In the good old US of A, the Federal Deposit

Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has an unbroken track

record of repaying insured deposits, as the American

# Page 7

BankNotes   - Nelson Nash’s Monthly Newsletter -          April 2013

Banking Association is quick to remind us. "While

the crisis in Cyprus is a real concern for depositors in

Cypriot banks, it has no implication for depositors in

U.S. institutions."

You gotta believe it because, see, the FDIC has $33

billion in reserves to handle such occasions. Banks

pay into the fund each year to make sure there is

money to repay depositors. The ABA states, "Simply

put, U.S. insured depositors are safe and their deposits

are protected by a strong FDIC fund, a financially

secure banking system and the full faith and credit of

the U.S."

So there.

OK, but while $33 billion sounds like a lot of

money, total domestic bank deposits in the U.S. stand

at over $9.4 trillion. Of that, $7.4 trillion are insured.

That means the FDIC's reserve fund provides 45

basis points (a basis point is 1/100th of 1%) worth of

coverage. Only a bank trade group would characterize

that coverage as "strong."

And just how financially secure is the banking

system?

Over at The New York Times, Floyd Norris makes

the point that if the big banks in the U.S. used the

same accounting rules as Europe, U.S. banks would

be much bigger. But more to the point, it would be

apparent that JP Morgan (for instance) is an even

bigger financial edifice teetering on the head of a pin.

JPM has $2.4 trillion in stated assets, but it also

has derivatives with an additional market value of

$1.5 trillion not listed on their balance sheet. So

instead of being leveraged at 11.6-to-1 and being well

capitalized, JPM is employing leverage at just short

of 19-to-1 and is a dicier proposition.

Nothing can go wrong when leveraged at 19-to-1.

That's OK. JPMorgan head man Jamie Dimon is

supposed to be the smartest guy in the room. Not

according to Jim Rickards, however, who told Maria

Bartiromo and Bill Griffeth on CNBC that Dimon

makes money only because of government subsidies

and doesn't understand the risks of derivatives.

The author of Currency Wars shocked the CNBC

anchors saying, "Having Jamie Dimon as CEO is like

having a welder in charge of a hospital. You don't want

someone working on your heart with a blowtorch."

You might wonder why JP Morgan and their peers

don't have to count the derivatives. Well, as Norris

explains:

"Under American accounting rules, banks that deal

in derivatives can net out most of their exposure by

offsetting the assets against the liabilities. They do

this based not on the nature of the asset or liability,

but on the identity of the institution on the other side

of the trade -- the counterparty, in market lingo.

"The logic of this has to do with what would happen

in a bankruptcy. What are called 'netting agreements'

allow only the net value to be claimed in case of a

failure. So the bank shows the sum of those net

positions with each party."

Of course, no one knows for sure the strengths and

weaknesses of their counterparties in a pinch. The

three simple letters that remind us are A-I-G. The

notional amount of derivatives in federally regulated

institutions at the end of last year was $224 trillion,

nearly 10 times greater than the derivatives exposure

at banks in the dark ages of 1997, which was $25.4

trillion at year-end.

The accountants were going to blow up this whole

netting exercise thing a few years ago. The bankers

got them to back off. Most derivatives positions are

disclosed in the financial footnotes, but repo and

reverse repo positions are not. According to Norris:

"The sort-of invisible derivative assets and

liabilities are only part of the reason that it is so hard

to really get a handle on just how risky any given bank

is. Regulators look at banks' 'Tier 1 capital ratios,' in

which they divide capital by 'risk-weighted assets.'

They get high numbers."

A 300-page report prepared for the Senate

concerning JP Morgan's $6.2 billion loss contends the

bank hid the loss from regulators and investors. Of

course, if you're the smartest guy in the room like Mr.

Dimon, you can make the numbers up as you go and

tell investors it's all a "tempest in a teapot." Just what

were those London Whale trades? The subcommittee

report described the portfolio as a "make-believe

voodoo magic composite hedge."

Bank earnings in 2012 were the second highest ever.

But the largest contribution to earnings came from

reduced provisions for loan losses, plus increased

trading revenue and asset sales. Another downturn

and this all reverses itself in a hurry.

Finally, the last line of defense for U.S. depositors

is the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.

Uncle Sam is an entity with over $16 trillion in direct

obligations and is currently running an annual deficit

of somewhere around $1 trillion, give or take.

Social Security and other promises stretch the total

obligations to numbers beyond comprehension.

On the plus side, for now, dollars can be created ad

infinitum from nowhere.

That's the real problem. The Cypriots can't print

their own money and are depending upon the kindness

of strangers.

Americans should take a lesson from the Cypriots,

just in case one of these days the product of Uncle

Sam's printing press is not so welcomed and the

notion of "unthinkable" is tested.

Anatomy of the Bank Run

Mises Daily: Monday, March 25, 2013

by Murray N. Rothbard

[This article is featured in chapter 79 of Making

Economic Sense by Murray Rothbard and originally

appeared in the September, 1985 edition of The Free

Market]

It was a scene familiar to any nostalgia buff: all-

night lines waiting for the banks (first in Ohio, then

in Maryland) to open; pompous but mendacious

assurances by the bankers that all is well and that

the people should go home; a stubborn insistence by

depositors to get their money out; and the consequent

closing of the banks by government, while at the same

time the banks were permitted to stay in existence and

collect the debts due them by their borrowers.

In other words, instead of government protecting

private property and enforcing voluntary contracts, it

deliberately violated the property of the depositors by

barring them from retrieving their own money from

the banks.

All this was, of course, a replay of the early 1930s:

the last era of massive runs on banks. On the surface

the weakness was the fact that the failed banks were

insured by private or state deposit insurance agencies,

whereas the banks that easily withstood the storm

were insured by the federal government (FDIC

for commercial banks; FSLIC for savings and loan

banks).

But why? What is the magic elixir possessed by

the federal government that neither private firms

nor states can muster? The defenders of the private

insurance agencies noted that they were technically in

better financial shape than FSLIC or FDIC, since they

had greater reserves per deposit dollar insured. How

is it that private firms, so far superior to government

in all other operations, should be so defective in this

one area? Is there something unique about money that

requires federal control?

The answer to this puzzle lies in the anguished

statements of the savings and loan banks in Ohio

and in Maryland, after the first of their number went

under because of spectacularly unsound loans. "What

a pity," they in effect complained, "that the failure of

this one unsound bank should drag the sound banks

down with them!"

But in what sense is a bank "sound" when one

whisper of doom, one faltering of public confidence,

should quickly bring the bank down? In what other

industry does a mere rumor or hint of doubt swiftly

bring down a mighty and seemingly solid firm? What

is there about banking that public confidence should

play such a decisive and overwhelmingly important

role?

The answer lies in the nature of our banking system,

in the fact that both commercial banks and thrift

banks (mutual-savings and savings-and-loan) have

been systematically engaging in fractional-reserve

banking: that is, they have far less cash on hand than

there are demand claims to cash outstanding. For

commercial banks, the reserve fraction is now about

10 percent; for the thrifts it is far less.

This means that the depositor who thinks he has

$10,000 in a bank is misled; in a proportionate sense,

there is only, say, $1,000 or less there. And yet, both

the checking depositor and the savings depositor

think that they can withdraw their money at any

time on demand. Obviously, such a system, which is

considered fraud when practiced by other businesses,

rests on a confidence trick: that is, it can only work so

long as the bulk of depositors do not catch on to the

scare and try to get their money out. The confidence

is essential, and also misguided. That is why once

the public catches on, and bank runs begin, they are

irresistible and cannot be stopped.

We now see why private enterprise works so

badly in the deposit insurance business. For private

enterprise only works in a business that is legitimate

and useful, where needs are being fulfilled. It is

impossible to "insure" a firm, even less so an industry,

that is inherently insolvent. Fractional reserve banks,

being inherently insolvent, are uninsurable.

What, then, is the magic potion of the federal

government? Why does everyone trust the FDIC and

FSLIC even though their reserve ratios are lower

than private agencies, and though they too have

only a very small fraction of total insured deposits

in cash to stem any bank run? The answer is really

quite simple: because everyone realizes, and realizes

correctly, that only the federal government--and not

the states or private firms--can print legal tender

dollars. Everyone knows that, in case of a bank run,

the U.S. Treasury would simply order the Fed to print

enough cash to bail out any depositors who want it.

The Fed has the unlimited power to print dollars, and

it is this unlimited power to inflate that stands behind

the current fractional reserve banking system.

Yes, the FDIC and FSLIC "work," but only because

the unlimited monopoly power to print money can

"work" to bail out any firm or person on earth. For it

was precisely bank runs, as severe as they were that,

before 1933, kept the banking system under check,

and prevented any substantial amount of inflation.

But now bank runs--at least for the overwhelming

majority of banks under federal deposit insurance--are

over, and we have  been paying and will continue to

pay the horrendous price of saving the banks: chronic

and unlimited inflation.

Putting an end to inflation requires not only the

abolition of the Fed but also the abolition of the FDIC

and FSLIC. At long last, banks would be treated like

any firm in any other industry. In short, if they can't

meet their contractual obligations they will be required

to go under and liquidate. It would be instructive to

see how many banks would survive if the massive

governmental props were finally taken away.

Murray N. Rothbard (1926–1995) was dean of the

Austrian School. He was an economist, economic

historian, and libertarian political philosopher

Number Thirty-Five in a monthly series of Nelson’s lessons,

right out of Becoming Your Own Banker®   We will continue

until we have gone through the entire book.

PART IV, Lesson 35:  Equipment Financing

continuation

Content: Page 62, Becoming Your Own Banker: The

Infinite Banking Concept® Fifth Edition, Sixth Print-

ing

In this lesson we come to the most exciting illustration

in the book, so far.  The young logger says, “This is

getting to be fascinating!  Is it possible to finance

more of my equipment without having to buy more

life insurance?”  Now, really!  How blind can he be?

The smartest thing he could possibly do is to buy more

life insurance to expand the capability of his system

to accommodate all his equipment financing plus any

other thing that he might need in his business.

It is the same principle as starting out a grocery store

chain.  A local grocer started one store about 45 years

ago.  It worked, and so they built another one in a

different part of the city.  That one worked, too, so

they built another – and another – and another, etc.

Twenty years later they had hundreds of stores all

over the country.

And, consider the banking business – has he not seen

branch offices of banks?  Why do banks do this?

Obviously, it is because it increases the profitability

of the business.  Otherwise, they wouldn’t do it.

Why can’t people see this when it comes to life

insurance – other  than the mental block that appears

when the subject is brought up?  Nevertheless, the

agent tells him, “Yes, you can start out by financing

three trucks for two cycles, but you are going to have

to wait until the cash value gets more substantial to

finance any more than that.”

Turning to page 62 you will see that everything on this

illustration almost the same as Illustration 4 through

the 12th year.  He has been financing 3 trucks and

has completed 2 cycles of doing so.  Now, the cash

value is $365,675.  At this point he can finance all

four trucks and one logging tractor.  Remember, the

tractor costs twice as much as a truck.

So, at the beginning of the 13th year he is borrowing

$315,600 from his policy and making loan repayments

back to the policy of $9,000 per month.  He repeats

this process every four years down through line 36

(his age 65).

Look at his cash value at his retirement time, now --

$3,518,411.  Compare this with the same point in the

illustration on page 55 ($1,517,320) and you will see

that he has made over $2,000,000 by simply doing

business at his bank.  His cash flow for equipment

financing has been the same in all these scenarios.

Look at his retirement income -- $225,000 per year

for life – it doesn’t matter how long he lives.  Again,

assuming death at age 85, he has recovered all that he

has paid into the policy, plus $3,328,816 in income –

and he still delivered $5,528,516 to his beneficiary!!

That’s a total of $8,857,332 of benefits and he doesn’t

have a dime invested.  He recovered all costs at the

end of the fourth year of income.

This is a startling improvement over the example on

page 55 where the insurance company managed it all.

The “gophers” at the insurance company had nothing

to do with this improvement.  It was all because of how

the policy owner directed his cash flow to his policy

instead of to the “gate-keepers & toll-takers” at the

“Great Wall of China.”  He has simply recovered the

$2,000,000 that they were making off of him when he

depended on them for financing.  They had the gold

– and so they made the rules!  After he capitalized a

banking system for four years at the rate of $40,000

per year through whole-life insurance, now he had

the gold and could make his own rules.  The name

of the game is creating gold!  It is all pretty simple,

but the results stagger the imagination!  It is a matter

of understanding the play in the financial world and

deciding which character you want to be in it.

There is one more item to cover before we conclude

Nelson’s Live Seminars  & Events

for  April 2013

http://infinitebanking.org/seminars/

Our comprehensive Becoming Your Own Banker®

seminar is organized into a five-part, ten-hour

consumer-oriented study of The Infinite Banking

Concept® and uses our book Becoming Your Own

Banker® as the guide. Typically, Nelson covers the

concept’s fundamentals in a two-hour introductory

block the first day. He then covers the “how to” over

an eight-hour block the final day. These seminars

are sponsored therefore attendance is dictated by the

seminar sponsor. If you are interested in attending one

of these events, please call or email the contact person

listed with the seminar information.

this lesson.  Look at the Net Annual Outlay column,

line 36, and you will see that his payment that year is

only $79,384.   To be “honest banker” with himself he

should have paid $108,000.  The reason the payment

is not up to par is because the policy will not hold it.

The policy is a Life Paid-Up at 65 and there is no way

to put additional money into it.

Take a deep breath and digest this lesson thoroughly

because we will be looking at ways to improve upon

this situation in the next lesson. Our logger friend

may feel pretty good at this point, but he still hasn’t

come close to maximizing his potential!

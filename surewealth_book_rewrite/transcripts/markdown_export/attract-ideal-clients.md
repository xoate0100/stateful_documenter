Are You Missing The Boat!!!

Before we get into ... How to Attract and Sell the 'Ideal Insurance Prospects' For

Your Current Products and Services ... and we reveal the 'Simple' Strategies You

Need To Quickly Double and Triple Your Leads, Appointments and Sales in the

next 60 to 180 days ... I' ve something really important to get off my chest.

Most of the agents, advisors and planners who read this won't want to

hear what l'm about to say... But they are missing the boat, big time!

Most of these people want to believe there is a 'Quick Solution' to being

successful in sales, or taking their sales to the next level. They want to

believe all the hype out there and believe there are magical lead sources,

lead systems, or a hot new sales idea that will have people begging for an

appointment and begging to be sold. They want to believe that if they

have the best product, price, investment returns, and/or a hot new sales idea, then all they

have to do is show up and they' ll make a ' Bazillion Dollars!'

However, the actual evidence is ... 86% of the people who enter insurance sales are out

of the industry within four years. And, the few agents and advisors who do manage to

survive four years are making an average net income of only $45,000 per year!

"According to the American Council for Life Insurance, the number of life

insurance agents has shrunk by nearly 100,000 in recent years. For every 1,000

agents recruited, only 14% survive the first four (4) years. Surviving agents only

produce an average of $45,000 of earnings in their fourth (41h) contract year."

I know that almost every recruiter, agency head and lead company is

telling you that they have a great turnkey lead and sales system.

And, if you follow their system, they' ll guarantee you' ll make a

'Bazillion Dollars!'

But, the actual facts state something entirely different. Only 'One

Out of Six' agents are surviving past 4 years. And, only ' One Out

of Ten ' of those surviving agents are earning $100,000 or more per

year. If you do the math, that means that out of I 000 agents hired this year, only 140

agents will survive and be earning approximately $45,000 per year by year four. (860

agents will fail, 140 will survive) And, only 14 will be earning $ 100,000 or more.

Obviously, no matter what you are being told, or what you want to

believe, the odds of you surviving and making a significant six-figure

income in insurance sales ... is only 1.4 out of 100!

However, you can get off to a quick start, dramatically increase the odds of your

survival, and you can be earning a consistent six-figure income (or seven- figure income)

with the right knowledge, training, coaching and mentoring. It starts by you learning how

to become the most respected 'Trusted' financial advisor in your local community.

The one person people want to see, so you can consistently attract the 'Ideal Insurance

Prospects' to you. And that's about you learning how to make a positive difference in

people's lives, instead of just making a sale !

Unfortunate ly, if you want to have your best chance of succeeding, then you can't just

rely on what a recruiting organization tells you, or gives you. As the President of a one

of the largest IMOs in the country told me after reviewing one of our marketing and sales

systems ... (He had called me and asked me to send him our system so he could review it.)

"I glanced at the information you sent me and it would not fit our focus because of

amount of time it takes to get the training done. Excellent material! Our tra ining

process is to get as many people as we ca n on the boat to find out who can write

before we spend any time or money training them." (This is a Direct Quote!)

Unfortunately, I've gotten very similar responses from many of the large IMOs and large

career agency companies. They believe it's cheaper for them to play the numbers game,

than to spend their time and money training the agents. I was told the same things by

upper management, when I was a branch manager for a Major Insurance Company.

The questions you should be asking are ...

» What does it take to succeed today in insurance sales?

» What training do I need?

»

Where do I get the training?

It's up to you! You can continue to believe all of the hype,

or you can take complete control of your career starting today!

Proven 80°/o Success Rate ... (documented)

My name is Lew Nason, and my son Jeremy and I have been tramrng agents and

advisors for 3 decades on how to properly apply these powe1f ul insurance and annuity

sales concepts to actually help people. Example: As a Manager for Met Life, from

1989-94, I hired 23 brand new agents. Over I 0 years later, 18 of those agents were still

in this business. That's an '80% Success Rate', verses the industry's 86% fail ure rate!

Proven Significant Six Figure Annual Incomes ... (documented)

Plus, all 18 of those agents were making more than $ 100,000 per year. Today, many of

them are making $200,000, $300,000 and much more! Consider, according to LIMRA,

the average net income per agent (or advisor) is less than $45,000 per year. The people

we've trained have net incomes well above $ 1 50,000 per year.

That's More Than Triple the Industry Averages! And puts them in the top 1% of all

agents today!

Please Listen: Over the years, you are going to spend thousands of dollars in time,

money and effort building your business. Why not learn to do it the most effective,

money-making way? Why not learn the marketing, prospecting and sales strategies

that the most successful agents and advisors on the planet use to attract and sell their

'Ideal Insurance Prospects'? It just makes good sense.

Master the Greatest Business Skill

You Can Ever Learn!

Would you like to know what the greatest business skill you could ever learn is?

Well, please pay close attention. The skill f'm talking about is ...

'Knowing How to 'ATTRACT' the 'Ideal Insurance Prospects'

I' ll bet you' re thinking;"/ already knew that!"

The problem is that most agents and advisors don't really

understand this skill. They think it's just a numbers game ...

just finding enough people to talk to. They think they can

buy leads, or send out sales letters to get leads, and as long as

they have the best products, the lowest premiums, best

returns and a good sales spiel they' ll close sales. Wouldn't it

be great if it were that easy?

Obviously, there is a lot more to it than that! And, when you fully understand this skill

and you've learned how to do this exceptionally well, you' ll be able to make the kind of

income you want from your insurance business ...

The advisors who are earning at least $250,000 a year all understand and have mastered

this skill. And, once you understand and master it, you'll also be able to make the same

or even greater income ... almost effortlessly!

Before we go any further ... We're not some ivory tower, home office guys. These

insurance and annuity marketing, lead generation, appointment setting and sales

principles we are about to reveal to you aren't some theoretical babble we' ve learned

from a book, or just dreamed up. These are real world, proven insurance marketing and

sales strategies that we've learned over the past three decades working with many of the

true legends in this industry studying, testing and refining their techniques. We've been

in the trenches, just like you.

And, we've been selling insurance, annuities and

investments and training agents, advisors and planners for three decades.

Understanding and Mastering This Skill

Attracting the 'Ideal Insurance Prospects' is actually composed of three distinct skills ...

'The Right Message ... To the Right Prospects ... At the Right Time!'

These three skills, in simple terms, are about you becoming a specialist in solving a

specific immediate PROBLEM for people ... deciding who the IDEAL prospects are for

your specialty ... then constantly delivering your special message to those prospects!

Important Message ... It might surprise you to know the agents, advisors and planners

we work with aren't doing anything that's really any different from what you' re doing.

There isn't anything that is really new. It's all been done before. They've just learned

6

# Page 7

a few little 'Insider Secrets' and 'Tricks of the Trade' below that makes them a little bit

better and much more successful at attracting the 'Ideal Insurance Prospects!'

Become the Trusted Advisor People Want to See!

Determine Your Specialty!

Is 'Sales' about getting people to buy the products that you want to sell them? Or, is it

about helping people to buy what they need and want to solve a problem they have?

This is where most agents have a problem and stumble right from the start. They have

the wrong idea of what selling is! So, when they get a lead, they have a problem turning

the lead into an appointment, let alone a sale. (The Right Message)

•

Do you have an urgent problem that you can solve for your prospect? If your

prospect doesn't have a problem, then why should they meet with you? If it isn't

an urgent problem, then why should they meet with you right now?

•

Does your prospect recognize the problem they have? What can you do and

say to get them to see they have a problem and agree to an appointment?

•

Does the prospect want to solve the problem? Do they want to solve it right

now? What can you say and do to move the sale along?

•

Even if they do want to solve the problem, do they have the money? What

can you do to help them find the money?

Decide who the IDEAL prospects are for your specialty!

This is another area where the vast majority of people have a problem. They want to

believe that everybody is a good prospect for what they offer. So, they waste their time

and money sending letters to, talking to, meeting with and trying to sell the wrong people.

•

Are there some people that are better prospects than others for your

products or services? Example: If you are selling life insurance, is it going to be

easier to sell it to single people, or to people with families to protect?

•

Are there some areas, companies, associations, etc. that have groups of your

idea l prospects? If you sell one person in that group, is it going to be easier to

set appointments with and sell the other people in the same group?

•

Are there some prospects that you relate to better than others? Are there

prospects who you have more things in common with than others?

When you

relate better with a prospect isn't it going to be easier to set an appointment and

close a sale?

Constantly deliver your Special message ... to the Right Prospects!

Most agents, advisors and planners spend all their time trying to meet with and sell

strangers, which is the hardest, most frustrating and most expensive way to build their

business. And, yet isn't that what most lead systems focus on!

•

How hard is to get an appointment with someone who has never heard of

you, or the work you do?

How much credibility do you have with these

strangers? How much trust do these strangers have in you? Don' t most people

prefer to do business with people they already know?

7

# Page 8

•

How much easier would it be to get an appointment with someone, if his or

her trusted advisor or friend recommended you and endorsed your services?

•

How much easier is it to make an appointment with people who have already

heard of you and the work you do?

In order to build your reputation, to become the trusted advisor people want to see and

attract tons of the ' IDEAL' qualified p rospects, you need to consistently use several of

the effective lead systems listed below. However, you have to do it in such a way, that

you are constantly delivering your special marketing message ... at the Right Time!

Stop Struggling With Your Marketing

Most of the advisors we talk to have tried purchasing leads, using information booklets

and free reports, client newsletters, direct mai I, postcards, joint venture marketing, dinner

seminars, educational workshops, asking for referrals, articles for the newspaper, press

releases, being a guest on a local television or radio program, lead groups, etc., without

much success. The reason they are struggling with these lead generation methods isn't

because they don't work. It's because they were never given or learned the I ittle 'insider

secrets' and 'tricks of the trade' to making these proven methods work. They didn't

fo llow through. They tried one method at a time. They were looking for 'one quick way'

to generate a consistent flow of leads, instead of learning how to combine each of these

proven lead generation methods into a complete marketing program that wi ll consistently

deliver your special message 'At the Right Time' ... to you put you in front of more of

the 'Ideal Insurance Prospects' in one month, than most agents will see in an entire year.

Imagine having an avalanche of highly qualified prospects phoning, mailing, ore-mailing

you each week, practically begging to meet with you. Wouldn' t this be a great problem

for you to have?

If You Want More 'IDEAL' Prospects, You Can Take The 'Trial and

Error' Approach To Try To Develop Your Own Marketing System, Or ...

You can have more 'Ideal Insurance Prospects' than you can handle in literally just a

few days from now by learning from the people who have actually done it. The people

that have already gone through the expense of the 'trial and error' approach for you!

What's In All of Our Lead Generation Programs?

Simply, we have identified specific immediate problems that you can use to attract the

'Ideal Insurance Prospects' to you ... in a virtually untapped market. They are the

prospects you have the best chance of setting an appointment with and selling!

We've also included a detailed explanation of 12 of the most effective and quickest lead

generation methods ... along with the philosoph ies and ' insider secrets' behind those

methods. ' Insider Secrets' like how to become the Trusted Advisor people want to see.

No more ... Cold Calling, Buying Expensive Leads or Taking A Commission Cut To Get

Leads! You' ll learn how to be in front of more of the 'Ideal Insurance Prospects' in one

month, than most agents will see in a year ... For under $200 per month!

Here's one simple idea of what you can do right now to quickly attract and be in

front of be right prospects ...

You Can Have More IDEAL Prospects Than

You Can Possibly See ... Starting Tomorrow!

It seems that every day for the past 3 years, we've been inundated with bad news about

our economy, the stock market and financial institutions struggl ing. ..

A IG In Serious

Trouble, Large Banks Failing, the Stock Market Plummeting, Higher Gas Prices,

Increased Mortgage Foreclosures and the '$700 Billion Bailout?'

Many of the leading financial experts, including Jack

Gargan, the founder of the IARFC, are predicting that many

large and small businesses are going to fail, as banks are

forced tighten up their lending criteria and deny loans. Will

that lead to the high unemployment and the runaway inflation

we experienced 40 years ago? Even with the passage of the

·$700 Billion Bailout', are we just postponing the inevitable?

Who's eventually going to end up footing the bill for the

bailout? What will that do to the future income tax rates?

How is all this bad news affecting your ability to find and attract new prospects, set

appointments and close sales?

Even prior to all of these recent financial pro blems, it's been getting harder and harder

every year for most advisors to attract prospects, set appointments and close sales, as

more and more families and retirees have been struggling with their fi nances. Consumer

debt has been skyrocketing out of control for the past 10 years. We' ve had a negative

savings rate for the past three years. CD rates have been extremely low, and the Stock

Market still hasn't recovered to the high point, where it was in 1999.

How many famil ies w ill have no other choice but to curtail spending and cut their

expenses, if they want to keep their home, their car, food on the table and keep from

going bankrupt? What wil l happen if they lose their employment?

How many retirees have already lost large sums of money in the

stock market, and with mortgage backed securities? Do they now

have considerably less money to generate the income they need?

What drastic choices wi ll they have to make to survive?

It's a

scary time financ ially, fo r almost everyone.

Unfortunately, the vast majority of agents, who have been just pushing products,

investment returns or the latest hot new sales idea, are struggling to make a decent living.

These are extremely difficult times. Many of them are not going to make it.

However, for those few advisors who have been focused on truly helping people, and

have become the trusted advisor people want to see, this will be one of the most

financially and personally reward ing times of their career. Who else can all of these

struggling consumers turn to for real help with their finances?

9

# Page 10

Every advisor has a golden opportunity to significantly prosper in these tough economic

times, if instead of pushing products, price and/or investment returns they statt focusing

on realty helping people to solve their financial problems. People are begging for and

want real help with their finances. They want to know how they can survive this terrible

economic mess.

Offering F ree Educational Workshops ...

You can attract more 'Ideal Insurance Prospects' than you can

possibly see ... starting tomorrow, if you' ll focus your message

and effort on truly helping people with their finances!

Can you help fam ilies to 'find the money' to reduce and/or

eliminate their debts; ·find the money' to start saving for their

future; and ·find the money' to purchase the insurances they

need to protect their family?

Can you help retirees to stop losing their savings in the stock market, reduce their income

taxes, and show them how they can have a guaranteed income they can't outlive?

Can you invite all of your clients, friends, relatives,

prospects and everyone else you know to a free

educational workshop on 'Helping Families to Live Debt

Free and Truly Wealthy, In Spite of the Economic

Downturn!' Or 'Helping Retirees to Guarantee a Life

Time of Income, In Spite of the Economic Downturn!'

And, the price of admission is to bring a friend.

Can you offer your free educational workshops to associations, civic groups and rel igious

organizations? Or, how about offering an adult education class at your local college?

If you can help your clients, friends, relatives, prospects and everyone you know to see

that you can help them to solve their financial problems, and they can have a brighter

financial future, even w ith all of the problems in our economy, how valuable are your

services to them? Won' t they all want to see you?

It's tilne for every advisor to step up ...

And start n1aking a real difference in people lives!

What Are The Very Best

Ways to Generate Leads,

to Get New Sales?

Many of the agents, advisors and planners who call us are looking for the quickest, most

cost effective and best ways to generate a constant stream of the highest quality insurance

and annuity leads, to make more sales. These people have tried purchasing leads, preset

appointments, using information booklets and free reports, client newsletters, direct mail,

postcards, j oint ventures, dinner seminars, educational workshops, asking for referrals,

at1icles for the newspaper, press releases, being a guest on a local television or radio

program, lead groups, etc., without much success.

As I stated earlier, the reason they are struggling with these lead

generation methods isn't because they don't work. It's because

they were never given or learned the little 'insider secrets' and

'tricks of the trade' to making these proven methods work.

Plus, they didn't follow through. They tried one method at a

,..

time. They were looking for 'one quick way' to generate a

consistent flow of leads, instead of learning how to combine each of these proven lead

generation methods into a complete marketing program that will consistently put them

in front of more of the 'Ideal Insurance Prospects' in one month, than most agents will

see in an entire year. (In spite of this economy)

What follows is a list of the best and the worst lead generation methods being used today,

and the primary reasons why they aren't working for most agents, advisors and planners!

The Very Best Lead Generation Methods (with Insider Secrets)

1. Referred Lead Programs ... There is no question that among the "million-dollar"

producers that referred leads are the best prospects you can get. However, the majority of

agents [ talk to are frustrated with them and not using them. Why? The main reason

most salespeople have trouble with referred leads, is they haven't made themselves

referable! People are not going to refer their family, friends, relatives, or associates to

just another salesperson. Insider Secret: If you want people to give you a referral, then

you must earn the right to receive the referral, by providing ongoing service, following

through on your promises, and establishing a relationship of credibility and trust. You

must become the Trusted Advisor people want to see! Note: The ultimale goal of

every agent, advisor and planner (or any other businessperson) should be to put their

prospecting on automatic, as quickly as possible. You want to be spending 90% of your

time in front of prospects, making sales. One of the best, easiest and most cost effective

ways to accomplish this is by making yourself referable and setting up a referred lead

.system that constantly generates high quality prospects ...

II

# Page 12

2. Annual Reviews ... If you ask these same "million-dollar" producers where they get

most of their new sales from each year, they'll tell you it's from annual reviews with their

existing clients. For example: Did you know that, according to LIMRA, the average

person buys life insurance seven times throughout their life? And, that's not counting the

other sales you'll get, such as Long Term Care Insurance, Disability Insurance, Annuities

and Investments. Working with, and coaching hundreds of agents each year, I'm shocked

at how many agents are not doing annual reviews with their existing clients. Most agents

are so focused and busy with bringing in new clients they are totally neglecting their

existing clients. (And, then they wonder why they aren't getting any calls from their

existing cl ients .. . or referrals) Insider Secret: 1f you are one of the few agents who

does offer an annual review, and your clients are refusing your offer, is it because they

view you as just another salesperson trying to make a sale, and not as a trusted advisor?

3. Dinner Seminars... While dinner seminars are somewhat expensive, ($4,500 -

$5,000 with the mailing and dinners) they are stil l one of the best and quickest ways to

generate lots of new prospects each month. When done right, you can be in front of 50 or

more high quality prospects in less than 6 weeks from now. Unfortunately, there are two

critical mistakes that 90% of the agents make with dinner seminars. Insider Secret:. One

is they try to go cheap on the restaurant and/or invitation. For example, they'll run an ad

in their local newspaper, to save money. The problem is the newspaper goes to everyone,

and not just to your best audience. So, you generally end up w ith a lot of the wrong

people attending. To get the right people to attend your dinner seminar, you have to

specifically invite them. You need to target your message to a specific group of people

meeting the right criteria. However, the biggest reason why advisors struggle with dinner

seminars is they are only able to set appointments with I 0 to 30 percent of their seminar

audience. And, then half of those appointments are canceling or are no shows. There are

several reasons why this occurs, but the predominant reason is the advisor is not getting

their audience emotionally involved in the seminar. Insider Secret: If the prospect does

not see and understand how the information relates to their situation, and how they'll

benefit by meeting with you, then why should they set an appointment? Note: With a

little coaching we've been able to help agents to set appointments with 70-90% of their

seminar audience, and those appointments are sticking.

4. Educational Workshops ... One of the most overlooked and very best ways to find

new prospects and introduce them to the services you provide is with an (inexpensive)

educational workshop. Would you agree no one wants to meet one-on-one with a

salesperson? The beauty of an educational workshop is that for the prospects there is

safety in numbers. People feel much safer coming to a workshop than meeting face-to-

face with a salesperson. It's a non-threatening way for them to get to know you, see the

type of work you do, and the help you provide. The beauty of the educational workshop

for you is that you can offer them in small groups. They cost very little to hold, at

generally less that $200 per event. And, because they are considered a public service you

can hold them almost anywhere - in your local library, association rooms, conference

rooms, etc. However, most agents have no idea how to get the right people to attend their

workshop. Note: To get the right prospect there involves personally inviting the people

you already know; friends, family, relatives, people you do business with, client referrals,

12

# Page 13

joint venture referrals, people who have asked for your free information booklet and

more.

5. Joint Ventures... Joint venture marketing is the ultimate 'insider secret' to

generating I iterally thousands of new prospects, in your area, rapidly and with the utmost

credibility. Are you looking for a way to be in front of more prospects? Are you looking

for ways to attract high quality prospects to you? Then, consider sharing your clients and

prospects with other successful business people ... in return for them sharing their clients

and prospects with you. When done right, with the right businesses, it can make your

search for new and better prospects much easier! As you know, the most successful

businesses maintain a list of their best prospects and customers. They use those lists to

send helpful information to them, to build positive relationships. Why? Because they

know people prefer to do business with people they know and trust. If you are thinking;

"J've tried that before and it doesn 't work!" The reason it didn't work is because most

agents are going about it all wrong! Insider Secret: Mosl agents are just selling up a

passive referral system where the business will refer people to them only if someone asks

for iriformation, or a referral. To make a joint venlure work you musl set up an active

con/act svslem thai gets people lo call you looking for help, more iriformation, or gets

them Ia come Ia your free educational workshop.

6. Lead Groups... Another great way to get high quality leads is by joining or forming

a lead exchange group with local business professionals that cater to your ideal prospects,

and who have already built strong relationships with them! A lead exchange group is a

formal group of successful business people who get together every week, or every two

weeks for breakfast or lunch, for about an hour to exchange leads. At every meeting, 2 or

3 members give a l 0-minute talk about what they do and who their ideal prospect would

be. Then, someone might share an idea that is helping them to grow their business. They

only allow one person from each industry into the group, so there is no competition. The

main criteria, is that each member must bring in leads each month for another member.

Note: I'm not sure why more agents are not joining or forming a lead exchange group.

However, !hey are missing oul on a greal opportunily. Insider Secret: Lead exchange

groups are a greal way to gel known in your communily, and sel up joint ventures.

7. Offering Information Booklets and Free Reports... Another big mistake

agents often make is they try to sell themselves directly in every communication they

produce. And as a result, they generate large amounts of prospects that lead to I ittle or no

business. They end up dealing with a lot of people who are merely curious, but never

serious. As we are now in the "information age", giving away a free report or a free

booklet is a great way to make your target market come to you. It's the "try-before-you-

buy" approach. When done right, the people who come forward, have been indirectly

screened and are qualified prospects for your products and services. You should be

offering your free report, or a free booklet in everything you do. (Even on your business

card) The problem most agents have with this lead generation method, is they expect

everyone who steps forward to buy right now. Unfortunately, people buy when they are

ready to buy, not when you are ready to sell. Insider Secret: To make this work you

must keep in front of these prospects, so when they are ready to buy, you are the one they

contact. And, you should be inviting them to your seminars and/or workshops.

8. Monthly Newsletters... It really surprises me that very few insurance agents,

financial advisors and financial planners are in regular contact with their Clients, Family,

Friends and Prospects! "Out Of Sight, Out Of Mind" Is A Deadly Mistake ...

Especially for anyone in Sales!!! Insurance Sales is tough enough without you giving

away the easy sales! Consider, everyday, your friends, neighbors, relatives and even

some of your clients are buying the same products and services you're selling. But,

they're not buying them from you! Why are these people going to your competition? Is

it because they don't know you're in the business, or if you're still in the business? Is it

because they never hear from you? Maybe the agent just happened to call them at the

right time? Or, maybe they called the agent with a question? Insider Secret: By sending

a monthly newsletter to your friends, relatives, neighbors, clients and prospects, you are

constantly reminding them of what you do (or in some cases, who you are) in a very non-

threatening way. It's non-threatening, because there's no pressure to buy anything.

Insider Secret: Remember, the example above - The average person buys life insurance

7 times during their lives. On top of that, many of them will buy Dl Insurance, Long

Term Care, Annuities, IRA 's, and other investments. When they are ready to make their

next purchase do you want them to buy it f rom the first agent who contacts them, or do

you want them to buy from you? http://www.insuranceproshop.com/Newsletters.html

Use Free Publicity To Get Known In Your Market ...

Insider Secret: Ho w much easier would it be to attract people and set an appointment

with them, if those prospects already know about you, respect you and the work that you

do? If you would like that to happen ... then you must seek free local publicity! You

must become the Trusted Advisor people need and want to see right now!

9. Be a Regular Guest on a Local Radio or Television Program ... Talk radio

or television is a powerful strategic tool to get your message out to the general public,

educating your whole community about what you do, and getting yourself known. It is

one of the quickest, easiest, and least expensive ways to get known in your local

community. People seem to think that radio and television talk shows are well-protected

kingdoms that don't allow outsiders to penetrate their walls. That's a huf?e

misconception! It's actually the opposite. Radio and Television Talk Show Hosts are

struggling to fill the thousands of hours of broadcasting time they are responsible for.

They want to give you FREE Radio Advertising, because it helps them out too! Note:

You've got GREAT information. You have an amazing product. You know that everyone

listening will want what you're selling. Now all you have to do is ask the radio producer,

or the talk show host, to allow you to be a guest. (Don't forget to send a press release)

10. Articles in Local Newspapers, Association Newsletters and the Social

Media... Get yourself published in every local media source and on Facebook,

Linked In and Twitter. If you need ideas, you can rewrite articles from the web. Be sure

to include your 'BYLINE' and offer a free report, in everything you do! An article gives

you much more credibility than running an ad for your services. And, it's free

advertising! Remember to make reprints of the articles to send to your clients, friends,

family, referrals and prospects.

14

# Page 15

11. Be a Guest Speaker for Local Associations and Religous Groups ... As a

financial expert you have a lot of knowledge on how to help people to better manage their

money. Many groups are looking for a qualified authority to share their knowledge with

their members. Let them know you are available. (Don't forget to send a press release)

12. Adult Education Classes ... How about offering an adult education class at the

local high school or college? (Before and after the event, send out a press release)

13. Be Active In Community Organizations ... The local Lions Club, Rotary,

Chamber of Commerce, Jaycees and many other organizations host civic events each

year. Be an active leader in these events and write articles about the event, with your

byline. (Before and after the event, send out a press release)

14. Press Releases... Press releases are one of the most effective ways to drive

potential clients to your website, newsletter, e-zine, workshop or seminar. You can

inform and educate prospects about the benefi ts of your financial services and reap major

publicity with little cost, effort, time, or trouble. A press release is a one-page summary

of the work you do. It provides the media with more information regarding why they

should write an atticle about you or why they should have you as a guest on their

program. It is imperative that the press release contains an interesting angle that makes

you relevant to the media's current audience. Make certain that your press release is a

news release and not an attempt to just get a free advertisement! Remember, especially if

you are creating news, that your press release must be qualified on an information, news,

educational, or entertainment basis. If possible, attempt to provide content of immediate

interest and/or lasting practical value for your intended audience. Your excitement does

not mean your subject is newsworthy. Respect the intelligence of your readers. Do not

scream BUY ME! Or gush w ith praise about how wonderful you are. Again, do not try

to cheat or abuse this opportunity to communicate. Resist the temptation to give your

sales pitch! You do not want media people to think of you as just another clown among

financial advisors or insurance agents.

The Worst Lead Generation Methods

Over the past 3 decades we've spent a lot of time talking to and working with some of

biggest producers in the industry. We've done numerous surveys and have yet to find a

successful advisor (who is consistently earning $20,000 or more per month) who is using

the following lead generation methods as a major part of their marketing campaigns.

These lead generation methods can be fine ways to fill in gaps and help with slumps.

And, they can be used when you are first getting started in the business. However, they

are not going to consistently put you in front of your best prospects ...

15

# Page 16

Newspaper and Magazine Ads ... Running an advertisement in your local newspaper

can be a low cost way to get some people to call you or attend your dinner seminar.

However, you never know if the right people will see your ad and respond. Generally

you'll end up wasting a lot of time and money talking to the wrong people.

Direct Mail ... There are two types of direct mail campaigns. One type is sending mail

to people you know, friends family, clients, referral from joint venture partners, etc.

which can be very effective. The other is sending direct mail to a cold, targeted list of

people (people who meet certain specific criteria.) This is commonly referred to 'junk

mail' as these people did not request it. [nsider Secret: ff you are sending direct mail to

a cold, targeted list you have to send out a minimum of 5,000 of a great sales letter for it

to be somewhat effective. And, that's very expensive. (That's why, for dinner seminars,

the direct mail houses will tell you that you have to send out a minimum of 5,000

invitations.) Unless you have a large marketing budget and a great letter, there are much

better, more cost effect ways to generate the right leads.

Buying Pre-set Appointments ... I haven't found or heard of any agents, advisors or

planners who are happy with their pre-set appointments. Insider Sec1·et: However, they

may used to fill in gaps and slumps.

Buying leads ... If you've ever purchased leads, then you know that very few of leads

are actually good prospects. Most of the leads are old and have been sent to other agents.

Cold Calling ... Cold calling is a hit and miss proposition. You have to deal with a lot

of negativity! Doing it long-term is a major cause of agent burnout!

Using a Website... Most agents use a web site just to give them credibility.

Unfortunately it's extremely difficult to attract local prospects.

If you want to generate a constant stream of the 'Ideal Insurance Prospects', to make

more sales, then you need to learn the "Insider Secrets" the top producers use to make

these proven lead generation methods almost "fool proof!"

That's what's in our programs! That's why the people we work with are consistently in

front of more of the 'Ideal Insurance Prospects' each month, than most agents w ill see

in an entire year. (In spite of this economy) And, that's why the people we work with

are earning $20,000 to $50,000 per month, within 30-60 days of investing in our systems

and training. http://www.insuranceproshop.com/productcatalog.html

Discover ... What Most Agents, Advisors

And Planners Don't Know!

Does this sound fami liar to you? When you first entered sales, for

the insurance industry, your main focus was just on finding

prospects.

If you didn't have a prospect, you couldn't set an

appointment, or close a sale. Initially, you looked for anyone and

everyone that breathed and was willing to sit down with you. You

.(

contacted your friends, fami ly and everyone you knew. You asked

...

everyone for referrals. You made cold calls. You bought leads and

you sent out sales letters. Or, maybe you were lucky enough to be

with a company that had a few orphan policyholders that you could

call on. You were constantly told that, if you talked to enough

people, you'd always find a few people who needed what you are offering, and they

would buy your product or services. You learned your sales script and you closed a sale

with almost everyone that sat down with you. You didn't have a problem making a

sale once you were in front of a prospect! You just needed more prospects!

A year or so later, you were working very hard and struggling to earn the living that you

wanted and were promised. You had approached everyone you could think of! You

were fru strated with cold call in g. You were only getting a few referrals. The sales letters

you were sending out every month were getting you a few new prospects. The leads you

were buying were generating a few appointments. You were selling everyone you met

with. But, you still didn't have enough sales. You knew that if you could be in front of

j ust a few more prospects or better prospects, you could be making a much better living.

So, you decided that you needed to find a better source of leads, or

a better lead system.

You searched the Internet and industry

publications. You asked your associates and managers, who they

recommended. You found there were hundreds of companies that

professed to have the best leads or the best lead generation system

on the market. Some of these companies offered automatic phone

dialers that would put you in contact with thousands of people

every month.

One company had a system for fax blasting to

businesses. Another company offered you preset appointments.

There were several direct mail companies that guaranteed they' d

have 150 people per month attend your free dinner seminars.

Another company told you, that if you offered people a free report you'd have hundreds

of people calling you and begging for an appointment. So, you tried one, two or more of

these companies.

You now have a lot more prospects, but not enough actual

appointments. You are still closing a sale with almost everyone you actually meet

with. You don't have a problem making sales. You just need better prospects!

So, now you decide to try some of the other lead companies and systems out there.

17

# Page 18

Does this story sound al l too familiar to you? It's a very common story we've heard time

and time again from thousands of agents, advisors and planners across the country. They

all believe they have a prospecting problem. Unfortunately, the majority of these ...

"Agents Don't Know ... What They Don't Kno\v!"

What you don 't know is ... If you are contacting enough people you will always make a

few sales, no matter how good or bad you are at closing sales.

To put it another way ...

'Even if you are the worst salesperson in the world, you

will close a few sales, if you talk to enough people!'

I'm sorry for being so blunt! But, I'm here to really help you to succeed and not just

tell you what you want to hear! The fact is that most agents want to believe they are

good at making sales, when the truth is that they are only making sales because they just

happen to stumble on an 'Ideal Insurance Prospect' once in a while.

As the old saying goes ...

"Even a blind hog will find an acorn now and then!"

-

Unfortunately, the majority of the companies who sell

leads and lead systems, and most recruiters are w illing to

take full advantage of your situation. They know that they

can make a ton of money, just by giving agents what they

want - more prospects. Even though they know that it's

not really what these agents really need! The majority of

these companies aren't concerned about your long-term

success. They are not going to spend their money to train

you on how to sell. They are only concerned about their success, and their profits.

If you want to really succeed in this business, then burn this into your memory ...

' It doesn't matter how many leads you get, if they aren't the 'Ideal

Insurance Prospects ', and you don't have the skills needed to turn the

majority of those leads into an appointment and then into a sale!'

Fortunately, there are a few good recruiters and trainers who are

willing to spend the time to help you learn and master the sales skills

needed to insure your long-term success in the financial services

industry. However, they are hard to find, and because they offer very

specialized, personal training, they tend to be expensive!

The best recruiters and trainers will show you how to quickly take

your lead generation to a new level by specializing and then focusing

your prospecting efforts on finding your 'Ideal Insurance Prospects'

18

# Page 19

for that specialty. However, they don' t stop there!

You' II also learn the critical sales skills needed to turn each of your 'Ideal Insurance

Prospects' into a solid sales appointment. You'll learn how to set sales appointments

by focusing on identifying and solving the prospect's immediate problems ... not by

focusing on your products, price, investment returns, a hot new sales idea or your

credentials. You ' ll learn how to ask the right questions to help your 'Idea/Insurance

Prospects' to convince themselves why they should meet with you.

Plus, you' ll learn how to conduct a thorough, emotionally based, fact-finding interview

that will get your prospects to tell themselves what they really need and want. And,

you' ll learn how to use that information to close '9 out of 10' sales appointments.

Yes, it all starts with finding the 'Idea/Insurance Prospects!' But, just as important

for your success, you must learn and master the skills needed to set appointments and

close sales.

Again Remember ... It doesn' t matter how many leads you get, if they aren't the

right leads and you don't have the skills needed to turn the majority of those leads

into an appointment and then into a sale!

Learn How To Set Appointments With '9 Out 10' People You Talk To!

If you want to set an appointment, you must learn what Top Producers know. It's all

about asking the right questions to help people recognize and understand the problems

they are facing now and in the future! If your prospect does not see they have a

problem, then why should they waste their time meeting with you?

Learn How To Close '9 Out 10' People You Meet With!

If you want to close a higher percentage of your sales appointments and increase the size

of each case, then gathering the 'Facts' alone is not enough. You also need to ask the

emotionally based questions to uncover the prospect's attitudes, opinions and unspoken

feelings. You need to uncover their emotions and motivations to help your prospects to

want to take action today! People don't buy based on their needs! They buy based on

their wants!

Asking questions is how you establish trust and confidence with your

prospects to build strong and lasting relationships!

One of the main reasons the top producing agents, advisors and planners are consistently

earning $20,000, $50,000 and much more per month ... Is they've learned how to make

the transition from being viewed as just a salesperson, to becoming the respected and

trusted advisor people want to see!

And, it's because ...

•

They've learned how to attract their 'Ideal Insurance Prospects!'

•

They've learned how to set appointments w ith almost everyone they talk to!

•

And, they' ve learned to ask the right questions during the initial sales interview ...

to help the prospect to sell themselves!

You Are Only An Inch Away From ...

Outrageous Success!

Do you believe it' s humanly possible for you to consistently close ' 9 out of 10' people

you meet with? If you don't believe you can, then maybe that' s why you aren't? And

yet, aren't most of the Leading Producers in our industry closing 9 out of I 0 people they

meet with? What is it that they know and do that you don't?

One of the most prolific producers in our industry, Van

Mueller, a three decade veteran and a 16-year MDRT Top of

the Table member, recently said in an ' Advisor Today',

Podcast: "Most agents think they are a long ways away

from being successful. When really they are only about an

inch away! And, they would be able to double, or triple,

01· quadruple their production!"

If you want to be closing 9 out of 10 people you

meet with, then it starts with you!

The first step is ... truly believing in what you do!

I know many of you may think this sounds a little bit hokey.

But, a lack of belief in what we do is one of the biggest

reasons most agents aren 't as successful as they would like to

be. Insider Secret: What the Leading Producers know, that you don't, is most people

will buy based on your set of beliefs, your energy and your enthusiasm. People want to

believe and know they can take back the control of their money. They want to know they

can have a secure financ ial future. And, they are looking for real help. ff you want to

sell them, then you must believe with all your heart and soul that w hat you do is valuable

and important! You must truly believe what you do really helps people! Your purpose is

not to sell products. Your mission is to show people how they can take control, and stay

in control of their fi nancial I i ves.

Until you truly believe what you do matters. Until people believe that

you believe, you'll have a tough time achieving the success you desire!

The second step, to closing 9 out of 10 people you meet with, is helping people to be

emotionally committed to going through the discovery process.

Selling is much more than just about you asking

questions to find out what people already have, or don't

have!

It's about you having a real conversation with

people to help them talk about, and tell you what they

really want out of their lives. Insider Secret:

It's

actively listening to people to discover what they

want, for their family and themselves.

Then, it' s

helping them to get emotionally committed to prioritizing

and find ing ways to help them to achieve their goals.

20

# Page 21

Until you learn how to consistently get your prospects emotionally

involved in the sales process, and get them to set their own priorities,

you'll have a tough time closing sales!

The final step, to closing 9 out of 10 people you meet with, is to show people where

they can 'find the money' to fund their priorities, to achieve their goals.

Would you agree that most people don't have any extra money? So, if

you want them to take action today, you must help them to change their

current spending habits. Insider Secret: And, you must do it without

asking them to make any major sacrifices to their current life style.

People are spending all sorts of money in the wrong places everyday

and they rarely think about it... whether it's a cup of coffee each day on

the way to work; a low deductible or unnecessary riders on their

insurance po licies; or the thousands of dollars of interest they are

spending each year on their credit cards and other debts.

Until you learn how to help people to establish their priorities,

and then help them to find the money to fund those priorities,

you'll have a tough time closing '9 out of 10' sales.

All of the great sales people in this industry have a strong, unyielding belief in the value

of what they do.

However, they didn' t wake up one day and just believe. They've

developed their beliefs and passion over time, by constantly listening to tapes and reading

books by current and past industry greats like Van Mueller, Mehdi Fakharzadeh,

Thomas Wolfe, John Savage, Ben Feldman and Frank Bettger. Everyday, they are

reading articles from the experts on ProducersWeb, Life Insurance Selling, Advisor

Today and Financial Services Journal.

And, they are constantly taking industry

courses such as the LUTC courses offered by NAIFA, the practice management courses

offer by the IARFC, the accreditation courses offered through the American College

and the sales skills and marketing courses by the Insurance Pro Shop.

Each of these Leading Producers has developed a repeatable sales process they go

through with every prospect. The vast majority of these producers didn't reinvent the

wheel. They have invested their time and money in a full time sales coach. They've

built their hugely successful sales process based on the coaching they received from

people like the Bill Bachrach, Michael Beck, Jim McCarthy, Jeremy Nason and me.

They've spent many hours refining their sales skills. Each of them knows exactly what

questions to ask to get their prospects emotionally involved in the sales process. They

constantly practice and are so well rehearsed, they don't have to think about what they

are going to say next, so they can really listen to what their prospect is telling them.

As Van Mueller said, you are only an "Inch Away" from being able to double, or triple,

or quadruple your production! And, we believe you are only an "Inch Away" from

being able to "Close 9 out of 10 people you meet with!"

Now the question is, "What do you believe?"

Are You Ready To Make A Commitment

To Substantially Improving Your Sales?

I' ll get straight to the point.

The next few pages could ho ld the vital key to a very

substantial increase in your sales leads and your sales, in

only a few days. That's if you' re prepared to keep an

open mind and be completely honest with yourself.

Honest enough to accept that perhaps the prospecting and

sales systems you are currently using aren't as good as

they should be.

Or, even humble enough to admit they're almost totally ineffective!

Rather blunt? Maybe? But, what's the point in burying your head in the sand? Just

hoping 'things w ill improve' won't solve your problem!

Your situation won't improve until YOU decide to take positive action ...

And YOU Make It Happen!

To add some credibility to these comments let me explain who we are, and then go on to

demonstrate how you can dramalicalfy improve your situation ... starting today!

As f stated earlier, from 1982 to 1989 I was in personal production and qual ified for

many prestigious awards and sales conferences with Met Life and NA IF A.

Since 1989, I've been training and coaching agents, advisors and planners on how to

properly apply these powerful marketing, lead generation, and sales concepts to attract

and actually help people. Example: As a Manager for Met Life, from 1989 to 1994, I

hired 23 brand new agents. Over 10 years later, I 8 of those agents were still in this

business.

That's an '80% Success Rate', verses the industry's 84% failure rate!

Plus, all 18 of those agents were making more than $ 100,000 per year. Today, many of

them are making $200,000, $300,000 and much more! Consider, according to LIMRA,

the average net income per agent (or advisor) is less than $50,000 per year. The people

we've trained have net incomes well above $ 150,000 per year. That's More Than

Double and Triple the Industry Averages!

Since starting the Insurance Pro Shop in 2000, my sons and I have helped over I 0,000

insurance agents, advisors and planners world-wide to double and triple their monthly

sales income, within a few months of investing in our systems, training and support.

But, that's enough about us! Let's talk about you.

So, you think you've done it all?

You've contracted with some great companies and have the top commission schedules.

22

# Page 23

You've got a steady flow of leads and a great sales presentation. You've got the top

products in the industry (for this week anyway). You've worked hard and you've got

everything you need to be a superstar in insurance sales. Yet you're still struggling to get

people to meet with you and close sales. Months of hard work, sales training and more,

but you're still only making an average living.

Look, contrary to what your managers and companies tell you, your success is not based

upon the companies you represent or the great products you have. It doesn't matter how

many designations you have after your name, or if you have the lowest premiums in the

industry. People prefer to meet with and buy from people they know and trust. And only

a well-planned, marketing and sales program will do that for you!

Why do some agents still try to buck the system?

Using top quality mailers, ads in newspapers and dinner seminars

will certainly expose you and your products and services to the

maximum number of prospects. But, without the right marketing

program to build trust, credibi lity, and a positive image, you're

just another insurance agent trying to make a sale!

Believe me; I've seen many intelligent and hardworking insurance agents lose a bundle,

because they stubbornly believed that the secret to setting appointments and closing sales

was a great product and company. They blamed the ad in the newspaper, the inferior

quality of the mailing list, or the current economic conditions for the poor response and

lack of appointments. Later they tried again with a new ad, a new list and a new product

and they ended up broke and out of the business!

It's not HOW you say it, or WHAT you say that sells!

Most agents also want to believe that a 'good talker', with a good sales presentation will

set lots of appointments and close lots of sales.

Agents wrongly believe that to be

successful in sales you need the 'gift of the gab'. Unfortunately, I've known many agents

who were 'good talkers' and turned out to be a hopeless salesman. Have you ever met a

salesperson that talked you to death? Or, a salesperson that confused you with detailed

technical jargon? Did you buy from him?

I certainly haven't got the 'gift of the gab'. And initially I

struggled in this business just like everyone else. I almost

quit several times. But, early in my career, I was extremely

lucky to meet two men who changed my life forever. They

taught me many things for which I shall be eternally

grateful ... like persistence, goal setting, keeping it simple,

self-belief and total honesty! But, the one most important

lesson I learned from them was that to be successful tn

sales, you must take the time to build relationships.

People have got to get to know and trust you ...

Before they'll do business with you!

Well it's over 30 years since they taught me that lesson, and I've never looked back.

23

# Page 24

Then, someone else showed me how to do exactly the same things, only much quicker,

by learning how to correctly market and sell my services.

So, how will you benefit from our programs?

It's really quite simple. And, it comes in two parts!

First, You 'II Learn How To Establish A Target Market!

We' ll help you to understand and establish yourself in one of the

best target markets for you in today's financial economy, based on

our 3 decades of research and experience. You' II learn how to use

the perfect combination of powerful, persuasive, and motivating

marketing strategies and tools to enhance your reputation to

consistently attract the 'Ideal Insurance Prospects' to you,

instead of you chasing after them. And, in just a few days you'll

be setting appointments with the 'IDEAL' highly qualified

prospects everyday. People who are ready to buy!

Second, You'll Learn How To Close '9 Out 10' Sales!

,

You' ll learn that if you want to close a high percentage of your sales calls, it requires

more than just gathering the 'Facts' about a person's financial situation. You' ll learn to

ask the emotional based questions to uncover the prospect's attitudes, opinions and

unspoken feelings. You' ll learn how to guide your prospects to discover (identify) their

own pain, to have them state it, to help them to sell themselves!

Through a series of practical 'nuts and bolts' articles we' ll quickly

strip away the mystique of marketing and sales. You' II learn how to

construct the fundamental building blocks that wi ll have qualified

prospects calling and buying from you everyday. But, you have to be

prepared to put in the effort. Because despite what Walt Disney said,

there isn't a magic wand!

So, if you're really serious about learning how to build your reputation. If you want to

have a consistent flow of the right leads, set more sales appointments, close more sales

and substantially increase your profits, then ... Let's Get Started!

"Many good financial advisors are not really good at selling.

They are great at marketing. The opposite is also true.

Many good salespeople are terrible marketers."

"If you're a good marketer, then selling is much easier.

If you cannot or will not market your products and services,

then you will have a tough time selling."

'Key ingredients of a quality Marketing Program'

Despite what you have been told or want to be lieve, the whole world is 'NOT' your

market! Even if everybody can use your product or service, there is a specific group of

people, with an intense immediate need for the benefits you offer. Find that 'niche'

and focus your efforts on really helping those people to solve their financial problems,

and you'll quickly discover how profitable your business can be.

To Be Successful, It All Starts With The Following ...

"A Clearly Defined Group of People to Sell To'

"No business can be al l things to all people. You must reach specific people

and satisfy their immediate needs. You must identify those people and

understand as precisely as possible what they want."

Definition of a Tar·get Market

A target market is a group of people that have something in common, whether it's a

hobby or business or whatever. These people have an interest level in something or other

that is cohesive, and they're all part of the same mind set; they all think the same way.

Characteristics of a Strong Target Market

•

Members of the group have a dominant, immediate need.

•

Group members are easily identifiable.

•

The group is large enough to make it worthwhile.

•

People in the group are easily approachable.

•

People who have money that is accessible.

'Satisfy a Dominant, Immediate Need'

'If You Want People to See You Today and Buy From You Today,

Then You Have To Find Out What They Want Today!'

we could recruit a few agents, advisors and planners and require them to contract with us

to receive our systems and training, so we could make an over-ride on their business.

However, this isn't about us making a fortune. This is about us giving back to this great

industry and making a difference. We created the Insurance Pro Shop because there is a

serious lack of any real, creditable insurance marketing, prospecting and sales training in

this industry. So, we decided right from the beginning that we wanted to give as many

people as possible the best opportunity to succeed. So, we are trying to keep it affordable

for everyone.

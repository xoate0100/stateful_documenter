See `docs/analysis/TRANSCRIPT_TO_WRITTEN_CONTENT_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` for gap analysis and integration plan.

### Usage

Transcripts are archived and no longer need to be referenced directly. All patterns, metaphors, and principles have been extracted and integrated into:

- `meta_framework/language/` - Language patterns
- `meta_framework/narratives/metaphors/` - Metaphors
- `meta_framework/narratives/allegories/` - Allegories
- `ai_prompts/` - Prompt system

The content generation system now uses these patterns automatically.

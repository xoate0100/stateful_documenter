How much money do you really need? It's impossible to know! It all  depends on how long you live, how healthy you are, what the inflation rate is,  and 100 other variables, many of which you can't control or predict. But  regardless of circumstances, the economy, or unpredictable expenses, there IS a  way to ensure that you have greater cash flow, fewer taxes, and more options.  
In this special report, we explore the many ways that permanent life insurance  can be used to give you a "permission slip" to spend down your other assets  intentionally... and still have more left over! We invite you to explore these  strategies with an open mind, and consider how they can benefit you and your  family. 
  
  
  
  
 Carol and John sat at their dining room table one morning, tax returns  
spread before them, and finally had the conversation they had been intending  to have. Unspoken questions about their finances had haunted both of them  for months now, and it was time to find some answers.  
Was their current financial plan sufficient to see them through the rest of  their lives? Would they have enough for themselves, and hopefully, leave  something to pass on to their kids? 
John had just attended his 70th birthday party, and Carol was 68. They had  enjoyed a good life during their later working years, but now that they were  retired and dependent on their investments to sustain them, looming  questions about their finances could no longer wait.  
Over the years, they had received plenty of financial advice from their CPA an d financial planner. They had followed their advice, investing in various IRAs, 
3 Asset Replacement 
stocks, bonds and mutual funds. They had scrimped and saved, planned and  prepared, trying to avoid their greatest fear: having life left, but no money. 
Now, they were at that point in their lives where they should be able to relax  and start living off the fruits of their previous hard work, but some of that fear  remained. What if it wasn't enough? Would they have any options? What if  they encountered unexpected health issues, or one of them required long-term  care? 
It was important to John and Carol to know that they would have enough for  the high quality health care they desired. It was also important to them to  have financial flexibility to support their alma mater and help with special  expenses for their grand-children, but now Carol wondered if they could  afford to help as they had in the past. 
To be honest, they had been avoiding this conversation. But today, John  seemed eager, even optimistic to discuss their finances. Two nights before,  John had attended a seminar where he had learned about an intriguing new financial concepts and strategies for seniors. The ideas presented had  reassured him in regards to the questions that had seemed so daunting just a  week before. 
As they sat across from each other at the dining room table, John asked Carol to listen to the ideas shared with an open mind. With retirement already  begun, and so many unpredictable future expenses, Carol admitted that she  knew their lifestyle was about to change drastically. And although she wasn't  entirely confident in the plan they had implemented, she didn't know what  else they could or should be doing.  
Their plan had seemed solid when they implemented it 20 years ago, but  inflation and changes in the tax laws had resulted in a lower bottom line. Just  when they thought they would be able to live a carefree life, they were going 
4 Asset Replacement 
to have to tighten their belts. Not only would they need to watch their  spending, but there seemed to be no real safety net for the unknowns. 
It disappointed Carol that all their saving couldn't guarantee they would have  "enough." She was disappointed, but she also wasn’t ready to throw the baby  out with the bathwater and go against all of their previous advice: "Spend interest only and maintain the principle bulk of the asset, and you'll never run  out of money." 
Protecting their principle seemed prudent and made sense to her, but it  didn't leave much room for error or emergencies. And once they started  spending principle, then it could all go downhill very quickly, because they'd  have less interest to live on.  
Apparently, according to the seminar John had just attended, the "never  spend your principle" advice had some pretty serious holes in it. One  problem they had already discovered: with inflation and changing tax laws,  living on interest alone might mean a much leaner existence than 20 years  ago. The national debt, income taxes, the cost of living and the gaps in  Medicare all seemed to be on rise, regardless of how they voted. 
Also, they realized that by leaving the bulk of their assets unspent, they were  allowing the brokerage firms full use of their hard-earned money, cost-free  and risk-free! John wondered... could they make better use of their assets and  increase their financial stability by keeping their money under their own  control? 
And finally, while that principle remained unspent, they paid income tax year  after year on the interest-only income they scrimped to get by on. Like some  kind of recurring bad dream, they kept paying the same taxes again and again,  year after year.

Carol could certainly see the holes in their plan, but wondered, did they have  any real alternatives? It scared her to think of changing course when they had  relied on this plan for so long. Besides, so many of their friends seemed to be  following the same script... could all of those people be wrong? 
According to John, they might be very wrong! One of the first steps this new  strategy recommended was to purchase a whole life insurance policy for both  of them. This would increase the value of their estate in the short term, as  well as create increased cash flow for them down the line, John explained. 
Carol was really not sure about this, after all, they were 68 and 70! Their term  policies had long expired, and she just couldn’t see the sense in life insurance  at their age. Not only would they have to come up with the money to fund  the policies (and she didn't know where THAT would come from, since they  were already tightening their budget), but she also didn't see how life  insurance policies would do anything for THEM while they were still alive! 
Carol admitted that the life insurance would benefit their kids when they  were gone; perhaps the two life insurance policies would even allow them to  fund their great-grand-children's college education, or benefit their favorite  charities. But how could the policies help them resolve their own money  worries now? 
John had learned that purchasing two life insurance policies could actually  help their current financial situation by doing three things. The new strategy  would: 
1. reduce the taxes they were paying to the government, 
2. increase their income stream without compromising the value of their  estate, and
6 Asset Replacement 
3. eliminate the principle the brokerage houses were allowed to use and  shift the assets to their own control. 
This sounded just a little too good to be true! Carol wanted to believe it, and  felt herself getting excited at the thought of fewer taxes and more cash flow,  but how would it work? Carol wanted to know exactly how two life insurance  policies could accomplish all that!  
John explained…they would be able to reduce the taxes they were paying to  the government by by intentionally spending down the principle on their  assets (stocks, bonds, savings accounts, CDs, etc.). By spending their principle, they would increase their income stream in three ways: 
1. They would increase cash flow by allowing themselves to spend  principle in addition to the interest each month. 
2. By spending down their principle, their taxes would diminish each year,  and many of those dollars would stay in their own pockets. 
3. A new, more efficient income stream would be created by shifting  assets from securities into permanent life insurance. Income taxes  would be lowered while dollars would provide savings and cash flow, as  well as a death benefit. 
By shifting these assets into a cash value account where the growth would be  safe from taxes or government intervention, they would keep the balance of  power in their families’ corner. After all, it was their money, so why let the  brokerage house control it? In this new account, the money could even be  easily borrowed against in case of emergencies or major purchases, even  while those dollars continued to grow and earn dividends.  
John explained that the purchase of the two life insurance policies was like  purchasing a "permission slip" to go against the typical financial advice they  kept hearing. This strategy would allow them to able to finally spend their 
7 Asset Replacement 
principle - as well as the interest they had earned over the years! After all, why should they work so hard and save so much, only to benefit the government, while they themselves remained afraid to touch their own  dollars? 
What if they could have their cake and eat it, too? 
Yes, they would have to use some of their assets to purchase and maintain th e premiums on these two life insurance policies. It wasn't going to be cheap,  but in the end, the cash value created and the death benefit would outweigh  the costs of the policies. 
This all sounded good, but the concept was so... different from the typical  advice they had heard. Carol wanted to see some proof that the numbers  really worked out. John had the proof ready. He showed her a chart that  really brought home the point about how the government drained the asset  through taxation when they withdrew only the interest: 
  
Figure 1
8 Asset Replacement 
Based on the example on the left, which represents what would happen when  couples like themselves leave the bulk of their assets with the brokerage  houses, Carol saw that over the course of 20 years, they would pay over 1  million dollars in taxes! They would pay a whopping $1,071,515 on their money - just for having saved so diligently!  
However, in the example on the right, which represents what happens  should they spend down their principle more quickly, they would pay  only $239,428 over the course of 20 years – a difference of $760,000! The  taxes would decrease partially because the principle would earn less  interest as they spent it down, but some of those taxes - a whopping  $276,441, would go right into their pocket!  
Most importantly, this strategy would also give them $120,000 more per year in spendable income, all because they decided to claim the use of their own  money rather than allowing the brokerage houses to keep it. 
But then, as Carol’s initial excitement calmed, she scrolled down to the botto m of the right column, and saw all those numbers in red ($73,212). She also  noticed that to the right of the dividing line between the two examples, the  happy couple's account value had dropped to zero. 
Granted, it had taken 16 years to do so, with less tax money and more spendable income in the meanwhile, but still -- Carol planned on living past  86, so what then? Not only were living expenses bound to be much higher in  18 years, but she imagined she and John might also be more prone to  maladies at that point in their lives. How would they live if they were out of  money? 
This is when John pulled out the second chart, showing where the two propos ed life insurance policies would kick in and create a new income stream:
9 Asset Replacement 
  
Figure 2a.  
(Part 2 of the chart - the next 20 years): 
  
Figure 2b. 
Now Carol saw that the new plan didn't leave her penniless at 86 at all. As a  matter of fact, it increased their cash flow $10,000 per year, giving them up  to $400,000 more in spendable income! 
Not only that, but in the early years of the strategy, it increased the size of  their estate considerably, as much as a million dollars. Carol felt re-assured 
10 Asset Replacement 
that as assets were spent down, an additional layer of financial security was built into their personal economy. 
Additionally, as John explained, they would use the bulk of the increased  Gross Withdrawal on the purchase and maintenance of the two life insurance  policies, which added extra value to their assets as well as enabled them to  spend an extra $10k per year. And despite the increases to their estate value  and cash flow, they still would spend almost $600,000 less on taxes than their  original plan of living on interest only. 
Carol also noted that by the end of the 20 years shown on the chart, their  Estate Value would still have a balance of $2.5 million, which is what they  started with in the previous plan. Yet they would have not only the additional  $10,000 to spend each year, they would also now have the use of these two  life insurance policies. These policies included not only a death benefit, but  cash value that could be used or easily borrowed against. 
Carol started to breathe a little easier...maybe their future wasn't destined for  financial uncertainty after all. 
Carol saw why John said that purchasing the two policies gave them "permission to spend" down the principle of their assets. The permanent  insurance was the buffer that picked up where  
the assets left off. Their Net Spendable would have increased by hundreds of  thousands of dollars, even though their assets would have been reduced to  zero. 
It seemed they really could have their cake and eat it too! This new strategy  allowed them to maintain their net worth -- and spend their principle. It would allow them to not only cover their living expenses, but also have a  contingency plan for healthcare expenses, increased taxes, etc., AND leave 
11 Asset Replacement 
something for their kids, their grandkids, and their favorite organizations.  This could be their legacy. 
There was one part of the chart that confused her, though… and that was the lack of mathematical accuracy that occurred at age 85. Carol noticed that  their Gross Withdrawal dropped drastically to $31,000, yet somehow, the  chart still showed their "Net Spendable” at $83,000 - just as it had been.  
Pointing her finger at the spot on the chart that showed this, Carol asked John, "How does that work?” 
John actually looked rather proud of himself as he pulled out yet another  chart: 
  
Figure 3 
John pointed to the top of the column that was labeled “PLI Cash Flow” (Permanent Life Insurance cash flow) and explained that, if you were to  overlay this chart onto the previous one, you would see  
that for the first 10 years after purchasing the life insurance policies, the
12 Asset Replacement 
couple would need to nurture the policies’ growth with $110,000 a year  (which would be funded through the spending down of their original  assets). 
Then, at age 85, when the previous chart showed that dramatic decrease in  Gross Withdrawal from $91,000 to $31,000, the policies' cash value would be  healthy enough to start adding $60,000 to their Net Spendable. 
In other words, the policy that they had paid into in their 70's would start  paying THEM in their 80's! 
This got Carol excited, because she was really starting to understand just how  much of a "permission slip" these two life insurance policies would be! But  then, it dawned on her... would that $60,000 per year be taxed as income? To  this, John replied with a smile, "No, that is net after taxes." 
Carol did notice that both the “Cash Value” and the “Death Benefit” were gradually decreasing with every $60,000 withdrawal from their life insurance  policies. Carol questioned John about this, wondering if she should be  concerned.  
John happily showed her the last chart, which carried out the same  calculations as above for 15 more years. This assured Carol that even if they  lived to be 109 years old, their life insurance policies, which would have  supplemented their income for 25 years, would still have over $1.2 million  in Cash Value and Death Benefit: 
(See Figure 4, next page)
13 Asset Replacement 
  
Figure 4 
Carol was reassured. It had taken a lot longer than their usual breakfast chats,  but by the time lunch was rolling around, she was starting to get her feet  under the idea of paying down their  
assets and purchasing life insurance policies. 
Then John pulled out yet another pamphlet from a company called "One  Reverse Mortgage." He explained that in case the worst should happen...  higher taxes, runaway inflation, health setbacks, etc., they had still another  option they could take advantage of in their mid-80's for an additional  monthly income: a Reverse Mortgage. 
Carol had heard about Reverse Mortgages, but they had always intended to  leave their home to their kids as part of their estate. She questioned, "John,  isn't that wrong somehow? I mean, it just doesn't seem right to sell our house  back to the bank, piece by piece, leaving us and the kids with nothing to show  for all those years when we scrimped and saved just to pay the mortgage each month!" 
John explained how the cushion of the life insurance policies made this a  more viable contingency option. "Think about it this way, Carol," he said. "By 
14 Asset Replacement 
using the Reverse Mortgage concept, the kids will be absolved of the  responsibility of trying to come to some kind of agreement about what to  do with the house once we've passed. They can just leave it in the bank's  hands! No one has to fly back here to come up with agreements or debate  who gets to live in it; they can allow to bank to take care of it." 
"It really is the kinder thing to do to the kids," John continued. "They’ll have  enough on their plates, both financially and emotionally when we pass. If they  do decide to keep the house, then they can use the policies' Death Benefit to  do so. Otherwise, they let the bank keep the house, and use the life insurance  monies for something else!"  
Carol had never thought about this before, but she realized that they had  never even talked with their kids about the house, or considered that there  might be easier solutions than leaving the house for them to deal with. John  also assured her that it was just one possibility - an option for increasing cash  flow further if needed.  
John also shared with Carol that, likewise, the two death benefits in the  permanent policies would remain assets that can be sold if that was ever  deemed necessary. As he explained, "A life insurance contract is sort of like  a real estate deed - it represents an asset of concrete value that can actually  be sold, if desired." 
Assuring Carol he wasn't actually suggesting that they would sell their policy  benefits, John got back to one of the big concepts he learned at the seminar  that did apply to them.  
"The core idea is this -- if we completely exhaust one asset, before moving on  to another, then we can reduce our taxes and increase our income. What  most people do instead is this: they take a little bit here and there from the variety of assets they own, but meanwhile, they don't really control their own 
15 Asset Replacement 
assets. They try to "live off the interest," and as a result, they remain subject  to taxes from the government, not to mention continuing brokerage house fees, as well." 
Now Carol's eyes got big as she had one of those "Aha" moments. "Wait a  minute!" she exclaimed. "I've trying to think of how to financially 'prepare for  the worst,' so to speak. But I'm realizing that with the benefits of these new  strategies, we don't have to wait for some big family emergency to liquidate  an asset, get a reverse mortgage, or take a loan against our cash value." 
Carol continued excitedly, "Your 70th birthday party at your daughter's house  was a blast... but could you imagine doing your 80th birthday celebration in  Maui and bringing the whole family -- grandkids and all!? Or taking them on a  European cruise to celebrate your 90th birthday? Maybe there's something to  be said for spending some of our assets while we are alive in a way that  allows us to see them enjoy it!" 
"That would be amazing!" said John. "But only on one condition... I refuse to wear one of those t-shirts that say, 'I'm Spending my Grandchildren's  Inheritance'! Of course, I'd be spending it WITH my grandchildren, and I can't  think of anything better."  
Carol agreed to the no-cheesy-t-shirt stipulation, as long as they could discuss  together how to let some of the extra cash flow from these strategies benefit  the whole family.  
"You know," Carol added, "maybe we've been engaging in too much scarcity  thinking with this 'never spend the principle' rule. After all, we've worked  hard and saved well, and you're right - if we use the right strategies with the  right mindset, we have more than enough to enjoy, be ready for the  unexpected, and still leave a legacy!"
16 Asset Replacement 
John was pleased that Carol was on board with exploring these new concepts,  and that she saw new possibilities in using permanent life insurance as a  "permission slip" to change their financial strategy and actually be able to  spend the money they had saved. By combining strategies that reduce taxes  and give them additional income as well as multiple "safety nets," they  could enjoy additional financial strength as well as reassurance. 
Carol confessed, “John, I've been so worried about money, but for the first  time today, I feel better, like we really do have breathing room and lots of  options, even when unexpected expenses come our way. But I'm also a bit  
over-whelmed, to be honest. It sounds like there are just so many variables,  that there is no way a seminar or book could accurately advise any one of us  on our specific situation." 
John agreed. "You're so right, Carol, we need personal advice for our specific  situation." And he knew just who to call - the advisor who had originally told  him about Macro Economics strategies.  
"Macro -Economics?" asked Carol. 
As John explained, Macro-Economics was a term he had heard at the seminar  that described an alternative to "typical" financial planning.  
"Before the rise of the financial planning industry, mutual funds, and 401(k)s,  many wealthy people practiced Macro-Economics, although no one called it  that yet!  
""I'm so on board with that!" said Carol."Should we call that advisor now?" "As soon as we have lunch," John said. "I'm starving!"

Liz Wiltsie: vehicle.
Andrew Daniels: Yep.
Liz Wiltsie: Then do we not want the capacity for more to be in there.
Andrew Daniels: Um, yes. And I, you know, well, I think I think yes to a degree. Um, I have people that when they realize kind of how powerful this is, a lot of times I'll get people like, "Ah, I should have like taken the money that I used to buy the Gatorade at the grocery
Liz Wiltsie: Okay. Right.
Andrew Daniels: store and like run it through there." So to some degree yes you want to maximize it but also it's not really necessary to like go super extreme and right and there so there is a balancing act because the bigger we make the policy it's like a
Liz Wiltsie: Right. Okay.
Andrew Daniels: it's like they're attached with a string and if you want the top to be bigger the the bottom has to come up too right yes so given everything that's going on in your life and how you're kind of
Liz Wiltsie: Right. Right. Those like minimum payments and stuff, right?
 
 
00:00:56
 
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: organized right now. I want to make sure, like I said, that we go slow enough forward that you don't have to go backward. And one of the things with life insurance is like we don't want to be in a spot 6 months, eight months, a year, two years, five years from now, right? The longer you have the policy, the more painful it is to get into a spot where if we need to go down to the minimum and that minimum is not low enough to give you enough breathing room in the moment, we don't want to be in a situation where you have to give up a four or five year old policy because you're four or five years older at that point.
Liz Wiltsie: Right. Oh yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Your rates are older.
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: If there's any health things that happen between now and then, once you have it, you have it.
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah. Right.
Andrew Daniels: They can't take it away. But if it lapses, we might have challenges getting another one.
 
 
00:01:47
 
Andrew Daniels: And I and then you have to restart the clock on on that. So, you know, I do work with people at different stages of owning businesses.
Liz Wiltsie: Uh yeah.
Andrew Daniels: I actually really like working with business owners because you you do have an opportunity.
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah. Yeah. You get to do all your fun things all at the same time.
Andrew Daniels: Yes. Yeah. When you're an employee and you you have a paycheck like we can manage that and I've got employees that I've shephered through all the way to retirement just fine. No big deal. But when you have a business, we do have these situations where, oh, five years from now, you might have a significantly different financial situation. As you get your business off the ground, what I would suggest is that we don't try to bite off too much all at once.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: You will have a recurring bucket of additional money to put in, right? So, $7,000 a year, you actually will have some ways to put money into there.
 
 
00:02:32
 
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: Now, here's some other things that we could think about. Um, and I think maybe I didn't quite finish this when I kind of was explaining the whole life.
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah. Yeah. Well, and like there's only so there's only so much we can do on a call on my lunch break, so keep going.
Andrew Daniels: You can Yeah, I know. I know. Um, we can always request changes to the policy, too. And so three or four years from now, let's say we look at it and um the business is going well enough that it supplements pretty nicely your income, but we're not quite at the point where you can leave
Liz Wiltsie: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: Apple completely. Um maybe we look at that and we go, okay, well, we we're building up surplus with the business income and we constantly every year have, you know, 10 or 20 or $30,000 additional. it's just sitting in a bank account now. It's not doing much. How can we move it into your system versus someone else's?
 
 
00:03:32
 
Andrew Daniels: At that point, we might say, "Okay, let's go to the company and say, hey, we want to raise the limits of the upper limits um further." The way we do that um is let me see if I have a graphic here because this is really Yeah, this is Let me find it real quick.
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah. Show me. Show me.
Andrew Daniels: Um because there's a couple of moving parts and pieces and if and depending on how we structure them uh we can go later and there's certain parts that we don't need to necessarily have a hard commitment to where if we raise it'll increase the bucket but it doesn't affect that minimum.
Liz Wiltsie: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: It might still require additional underwriting at that point but at least we do have a way to raise it in the future without having to restart a whole second policy.
Liz Wiltsie: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, so that's option one is that you do have some flexibility to to go and as long as you stay healthy and you know you know obviously anything could happen, right?
 
 
00:04:21
 
Liz Wiltsie: Uh-huh.
Andrew Daniels: You know there's I've had all kinds of things.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: I've had traumatic brain injuries. I've had people with you know a lot of immune disorders all but it's not actually that common. I think most people can get additional underwriting pretty easily unless they're aged like in their 70s, right?
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: It gets really hard.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. So, option one is we just say, "Okay, let's start here." Because it's a good balance between uh doing something but not trying to do too much. Um the other option, and I'm going to pull this up so we can see. Uh where is it? Where is it? So, give me a second. Here it is. Okay. And I'm going to share my screen. And then I also hit the record button so I can send this to you and you can kind of review it too because you're not going to remember all this.
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah, I see that.
 
 
00:05:11
 
Liz Wiltsie: Yep. Yep. Yeah. Perfect.
Andrew Daniels: There's no way.
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Um, the other option I was going to say is, you know, let's say the business just goes crazy, right? And, um, you we got way more and you were just consistently hitting tens of thousands of dollars in extra money even with the business that you're growing and whatnot.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: At that point, we might go, "Okay, look, this situation, you're dramatically different from when we started. We need to kind of reframe." That might be a time that we start a second policy. and you actually just expand your capital base. And that's okay, too.
Liz Wiltsie: So then you just keep the one and you keep the one that's like four years in that you're making more like more money, right?
Andrew Daniels: I've got people with multiple problems. It's It's more It's more efficient.
Liz Wiltsie: that you have, right? And then and then you just have another one. And then you just have another one.
 
 
00:06:01
 
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: So it doesn't it doesn't like close it or change it or whatever. It just is like actually we can have two if we want it.
Andrew Daniels: Yes. Yeah. And I've got some I've got some people with four or five.
Liz Wiltsie: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: Um, and I don't, and here's the thing, I got to qualify that. I really don't like to gratuitously just start new policies because you have to think of it like a you're, you're basically starting a money business is what's going on.
Liz Wiltsie: Right. Right.
Andrew Daniels: And it does take some time to capitalize. Uh, before the IRS got involved, it took less time, but now it takes about I think a good reasonable um expectation is to say seven years.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: And the reason I say that is because that's the limit. That's what the IRS says. That that's how so most policies if I can get them turned over where they're making more than you're even allowed to put in. By about 7 to 10 years, I'm happy because once that happens, you have a way
 
 
00:06:49
 
Liz Wiltsie: Right. Right.
Andrew Daniels: where no matter how much you put into it up to that limit, you're always going to get back out more. And I'll explain that, too. So, I like to I like to wait to start policies until we've got our feet under us on one policy.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm. Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: So, I I won't be just saying, "Hey, new policy, new policy." I don't like to do that.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: We're going to do it with reason and we need to have purposefulness with that.
Liz Wiltsie: Right. Right. Right. Right.
Andrew Daniels: Um, so let me let me explain this though because I think this might help answer the question too.
Liz Wiltsie: That makes sense. Okay.
Andrew Daniels: So, the policy is like a sailboat and um the hole the hole is that is the base part of the policy. And I'm going to pull up an illustration so we can kind of talk about this, but I think doing it in context of this sailboat is going to help you fit it in really well.
 
 
00:07:36
 
Liz Wiltsie: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: So the base death benefit, this is like all the life insurance that you've heard about where Dave Ramsey says it's not a good deal, right? This is what he's talking about. It's a it is a very long-term hundredyear. You're paying a premium and it takes a really long time to see any cash value, but you do get death benefit for it. This is what most traditional whole life standard whole life policies are. Um the mast. So this the mast is what holds up the sales and that's a term writer. Now yours um the reason we would do term writers and when I say that a writer is just an addition to the contract.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: It's like a oh here's our standard stuff.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: You guys are going to choose another option and we're going to add that option to it.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: And that's a piece of term insurance.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: Term meaning it only lasts for 10, 15, 20, 30 years.
 
 
00:08:32
 
Andrew Daniels: How, whatever we select. And it is an additional amount of death benefit. Meaning it's not accessible until you die.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: But here's why that's important is because back in the 80s, doctors were putting in $100,000 of cash to life insurance companies and they were getting $5,000 of death benefits. So super cheap, right?
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: and they were getting all these cash benefits and it was a tax haven. And the IRS came in, they said, "Well, you're obviously not actually buying life insurance. You're just trying to save money on taxes." So, they came up with this ridiculously complex calculation, and all you really need to know about it is that it's it's a seven-year calculation. That's where it comes from.
Liz Wiltsie: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: But the point is, if we raise the death benefit, we're allowed to put in more cash.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: I don't I don't want to put death benefit on here because that's the expensive part.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: I need you to have access.
 
 
00:09:29
 
Liz Wiltsie: Like that's where your premium comes from. Right.
Andrew Daniels: Well, yeah, it's all going to be premium technically, but when my most life insurance agents try to try to go the highest death benefit that we can get for the lowest amount of money, I'm flipping that.
Liz Wiltsie: The hull is where your premium comes from. Right. Right.
Andrew Daniels: I'm going to the company and I'm saying, "We don't actually want to buy your product. We
Liz Wiltsie: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: just want the cash, the ability to use the cash and not have it be taxable, but have it grow and we want all those other benefits." And there is a minimum amount of death benefit that we have to buy.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: The way we get around taking the available money in your monthly budget that has to go towards death benefit versus cash, whatever the bare minimum is for that uh base policy. And then if we need a bigger sale, which is what generates cash, so the level, what's called level premium paid up additions, LPUA or PUA, paid up additions, you'll hear me kind of say it a couple different ways.
 
 
00:10:28
 
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: If I could have a policy for you that was all paid up additions, I would. And by the by the end of what I'm going to show you, you will see why that makes sense.
Liz Wiltsie: Right. Right. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Um, but it's I'll just suffice it to say it's far cheaper for you to buy purchase a mast than it is for you to purchase a bigger hole.
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah. Okay. Understood. That make sense.
Andrew Daniels: And so I want you to spend as I want the dollars that we're using, if we've got a limited amount of dollars, I want as many of them as possible to go towards our sale and not towards our whole.
Liz Wiltsie: Right. Makes sense.
Andrew Daniels: So some of some of those we got to use the mask.
Liz Wiltsie: Got it.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. So um here's our initial plan and I think what helps so don't get overwhelmed here these and so a couple things this is an illustration um there's a lot going on here right and one of the things I will say as soon as you make your first premium payment all this entire chart is completely outdated so every time we talk um and we say okay well how's the policy doing we will run a new one of
 
 
00:11:35
 
Andrew Daniels: these to get the exact current snapshot. And I've had people, you know, it's happened before.
Liz Wiltsie: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: I've had people five, six, seven years in that they will pull up the original snapshot and, you know, they got a friend, they got a buddy, they got a brother, somebody that they want to, you know, have analyze it, which is fine.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: I don't Let's bring in all the the team for the financial advising, but we have to understand why we're doing what we're doing from the beginning and how it's changed. So it will change and um these numbers aren't going to be relevant. In fact, when I submit the actual policy, in order to maintain the flexibility for you, I'm going to submit an illustration that looks really wonky. It's not going to look exactly like this.
Liz Wiltsie: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: Part of that is because I want them to I'm going to have them set the minimum at the lowest possible amount, but I'm gonna I'm gonna leave the limits high.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm. Mhm.
 
 
00:12:33
 
Andrew Daniels: And that's how we give you the flexibility to not have to pay not have to actually pay $7,000 a year.
Liz Wiltsie: Right. Right.
Andrew Daniels: Your minimum is going to be like $2,000 a year. And that's what's going to show on this um on this illustration.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: So, what do we got here?
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: So, there's two sides to this. We have the guaranteed side. So this is the part no matter what you do as long as you pay the premium this is what the numbers will absolutely be. The difference between these two is the only difference right there's no uh investing in sub accounts or exposure to the stock market. There are policies that do that. This is not one of those. The only difference is the dividend. Now this this company has paid a dividend continuously for like 121 years.
Liz Wiltsie: Oh, okay.
Andrew Daniels: One of their big selling points that they know why people choose this company is because their stability, their history, but also because people like that dividend.
 
 
00:13:29
 
Andrew Daniels: So it would be a major damaging thing to their business were they not to pay a dividend.
Liz Wiltsie: Right. Mhm. Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: But it still has to be considered not right.
Liz Wiltsie: But it's possible. Sure.
Andrew Daniels: Um now they've and they've in fact I think they've raised their dividend and they've released like record dividend rates for the last like three or four years. So um highly financially rated. I'm not worried about that. So I feel comfortable talking about how the numbers will go here. But just so you know we do have a stop gap. The policy grows either way. Whether there's a dividend at all or not at all the policy still grows.
Liz Wiltsie: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: So like I said I want to give you a financial foundation.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: I want to set you a floor and then I want to make sure that the floor automatically increases every year whether you want it to or not.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: So, okay. So, when I've uh any questions so far?
 
 
00:14:22
 
Liz Wiltsie: Nope.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. And I'm just kind of laying the groundwork here and then we'll get into the nitty-gritty. One of the things one of the things I like to do first is I like to show people something very interesting because I noticed the talking heads out there like to like to rail against these kinds of policies
Liz Wiltsie: Got it.
Andrew Daniels: and they go well you know the company you have this cash that's uh growing in the policy and when you die they don't give that cash to you like they're taking your money. Oh my gosh. Right. Well, if we look at these two columns, what this is showing is that the the the first year that you have the policy active, you have a death benefit and you also have a corresponding amount of cash that grows that you will have access to. But I think it's helpful to look at the very end and see the logical conclusion of this growth. Um, and so you can see right year by year, we're getting getting older.
 
 
00:15:14
 
Andrew Daniels: you're in your 80s and 90s, 40 years in, but let's go all the way to the end of the contract. Life insurance policies of this kind are standard written out to age 121 because that's kind of their maximum theoretical limit of the age of a life, right?
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm. Sure.
Andrew Daniels: No one is ever I mean, not yet. No one is expected to live to the end of their contract. Now, I've had some clients who bought policies back in the 40s and 50s who are turning a hundred and they actually had a contract that ended at age 100. So, they did outlive their contract.
Liz Wiltsie: Right. Wow.
Andrew Daniels: And what happens in that point, what you'll notice is through the life of the policy as you pay premiums, the death benefit is increasing, but this cash value is also increasing. And that trend will continue. And if we look towards the end, what are the two numbers?
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: They are exactly equal.
Liz Wiltsie: They're the same, right?
Andrew Daniels: And that's because, let me zoom up here.
 
 
00:16:14
 
Andrew Daniels: Okay, there we go. That's because they're two sides of the same coin. So, if you're going to get a coin at the end of your at the end of your contract or at the end of your life, it's two sides of the same coin. It's not that they're taking your money. The mechanics behind this are are it actually it's very logical. um when you pay your first premium, you know, $300 or whatever it's going to be, the company's on the hook to pay an insane amount of money. Like if you send that check in and then three days later you kick the bucket, they've had three days to grow your $300, but they owe you $100,000, right? That's nuts. So, it's a pretty big risk for them. But as you pay premiums and get older and that the longer they've had to invest your premiums and make returns, they're going to credit that back to the cash part, the asset growth part of the policy.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: And that continues all the way down.
 
 
00:17:11
 
Andrew Daniels: When you get to age 121, if you didn't die before then, they would they would write you a $954,000 check and they'd say, "Oh, you've outlived your contract. We're no longer on the hook for paying you anything. take it and do what you want with it, right?
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: Congratulations, you're under 21. And that really I think that the the having that in context gives us a clue into why this is so powerful.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: Um and why I want to focus things on the cash value, the paid up additions that um where is that open? There we go. That paid up additions. this sailboat piece here or the the sale here. What it does is it actually credits you the full cash that you put in. So, if you put in $1,000 of paid up addition, you get $1,000 credited right away. And whatever corresponding amount of death benefit for the age that you are. So, at at 44, $1,000 might buy you, let's just say it buys you $5,000 additional death benefit.
 
 
00:18:15
 
Andrew Daniels: At 50, $1,000 might buy you $4,000 of death benefit because you're a little bit older.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: What what happens is this cash has to grow up to meet the death benefit. It has to follow those rules by age 121. They have to be equal.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: every every premium that you make right in and at age 44 in the first year has all those years to grow. It's going to grow at a slightly slower rate but by the time you're 50 that rate is compressed because you're a little bit closer to 121. So this where we get this roll of the money you put in
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: every day like literally it's daily. it will grow faster and faster and it's, you know, tiny tiny little fractions of percents, but it does add up over years. Um, okay. So, I think that lays the groundwork for understanding why the paid up additions are so important because it gives you it starts you at the cash value that you're that you put in and then it starts to grow versus brand new policy, you have to start at zero and wait for it to grow.
 
 
00:19:26
 
Andrew Daniels: And I think, you know what, one of the things I could do if I was if I was if I had my brain about me, I would have had this ready. Okay. Any questions about that so far?
Liz Wiltsie: I don't think so. I got it.
Andrew Daniels: Awesome. Um, let me get logged in here. I was logged out of this other site. Um, okay.
Liz Wiltsie: And it it says sub optimal because I am overweight and have higher cholesterol, right?
Andrew Daniels: Uh, oh, for the uh the rating, yeah, it does say substandard. Um, it's lit. It's not the uh maybe partially the cholesterol. Um, they told me it was the build, which they do have build tables for us. Um, but I I don't ever really care about that because we're not trying to get death benefit that the the rate is about, you know, how much does it cost you to purchase death benefit?
Liz Wiltsie: Okay, right. Okay, got it. Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: And I I think when I started on early, I was like really worried like, oh my gosh, what if somebody gets a a you know, less than standard rating?
 
 
00:20:28
 
Andrew Daniels: like how to but like I realized after working in the calculators their goals for rating are different from my goals of how I set up the policy.
Liz Wiltsie: right? Right.
Andrew Daniels: They are assuming Yes.
Liz Wiltsie: Which works out Oh.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. They're assuming that everybody wants to buy a lot of death benefit and I'm like we don't actually want to do that. So um I've actually had uh you know this is this is not a bad rating. I've had some folks I have a lady who had a traumatic brain injury 25 years ago and I think it's she's one of the worst ratings I've ever gotten. The most expensive. Um sometimes they'll just straight out decline, right? But she's one of the ones that they said yes, we will allow it, but it's going to be a lot of extra money.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm. Right.
Andrew Daniels: Well, that really hasn't been a problem. She started with $100,000 with me and she's not and what six years ago and now she's got almost 500,000 like we have not it didn't impact it at all.
 
 
00:21:24
 
Andrew Daniels: So that's kind of like the most extreme case that I have where I realize I'm like oh this is totally okay.
Liz Wiltsie: Got it.
Andrew Daniels: Here's the fun here's the fun thing as you you know you don't need to feel any pressure to kind of change any you don't need to do that right my you know Mary uh I mean you follow her on Tik Tok she lost 120 pounds after we had the twins she had already lost like 90 pounds before we had the twins right so she did it twice like I watched her do all of that it's hard it's a lot of work it's a lot of mental energy she had to do a lot of shadow work to like even get to the place where she was good doing that. That's not required here. You don't if you don't feel like you're ready for that. Don't feel pressured for that, right?
Liz Wiltsie: got it.
Andrew Daniels: Um keep doing what you're doing. Keep the focus the focus, it might be easier for you to do that when you don't have to work for Apple and you run your own business, right?
 
 
00:22:16
 
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: I don't know.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: Um but I will say this, if there is a point where you kind of get on that, you go, "Hey, Andy, I've made some changes. Things are looking really good." Um, we can go back, let's say, you know, six.
Liz Wiltsie: and like retest or whatever.
Andrew Daniels: Yes, we can go back and say we want to apply for a better rating and we absolutely, they'll do that.
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: I've had that happen where I've been able to take somebody that was substandard and inch them up to a standard rating. And it instantly changes the numbers on the whole policy.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm. Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: But again, that impact is is minimal because of the way we construct it. We're not trying to buy a bunch of death benefit.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: So that rate is not crazy for what we're trying to do.
Liz Wiltsie: What do you do with people who do want more death benefit? I'm think so my um how old am I?
 
 
00:23:06
 
Liz Wiltsie: 43. You know this. It's written right there. Um my brother is 32. um and is and had a daughter in November and so he is looking into just like regular term.
Andrew Daniels: Uh Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: Um and he has weirdly my brother is a like thin fit person with higher cholesterol than I have.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: And so yeah, so they came back to him and he's pissed um because they came back to him with a much higher uh lower lower rating, right?
Andrew Daniels: It's just genetic. It's just genetic. Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: Because and they want him to pay a lot more money.
Andrew Daniels: Right.
Liz Wiltsie: Um and so but he no he's um we have USAA cuz my granddaddy was in the military was career military and uh and so he was looking he was looking at it with them and I was just thinking
Andrew Daniels: Was this a policy that he was this a policy that he already had? Okay. All
Liz Wiltsie: about obviously um because of all the talking heads everyone has an opinion about right like everyone has an opinion and I'm like I'm not discussing this with all of you who like think you know everything about everything.
 
 
00:24:32
 
Andrew Daniels: right.
Liz Wiltsie: So like I'm just going to be quiet. But um but I it was the question that I had in my mind is that like if someone wants more death benefit like he does is is there a way that you work the numbers that that works out?
Andrew Daniels: So, okay. Yes. Kind of. Yes. Are you talking about more death benefit like at the front or kind of just over time you decide, hey, I need to bump things up. I need more because my situation's changed or I'm making more money.
Liz Wiltsie: I think I think he has I think he has the regular fear that normal people do of I have a daughter and I might die.
Andrew Daniels: Uh yeah, something.
Liz Wiltsie: Like not I'm going to die someday, but I'm going to die like unexpectedly and soon.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, this is more more urgent.
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: What if something happens to me now when I'm the provider?
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. And that's again, this is life insurance, too.
 
 
00:25:23
 
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: The tool that we're using, we can get those benefits while we're doing all of this. So, we can't forget about that.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: Let me show you something that I think uh here um what happens when we here's the crazy backwards thing and it this is every single client I have.
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: There's not a single client who has done policies with me that this is not true for and it's because of how I design it. The the death benefit should increase as you get older. That's the first thing.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: Like that's number one.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: But also let me show you. So this is this this uh document here. I labeled this the midpoint. So this is assuming that we don't do anything extra, right? You're just able to do this this average, not the bare minimum, but just midpoint.
Liz Wiltsie: Right. Right.
Andrew Daniels: Here's where I'm targeting the plan. So let's let's look at some numbers and just kind of store them or write them down in your short term.
 
 
00:26:19
 
Liz Wiltsie: Yep.
Andrew Daniels: Right? Year one, we've got about $1,200 in cash and 100,000 the death benefit. Year 10, we've got about $25,000 and 130. So, we've increased. Okay, let's go to the max. Uh, let me do one more one more point data point to show you. Let's look at like age 70. Age 70 um you've got $100,000 of cash and $200,000 of death benefit.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: So, we've doubled your death benefit by then.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: Um, and you'll also notice we've lowered the premium. We'll get into that if you have questions, but just there's some few quirks that I think are really cool. I don't want to overwhelm you with features, though.
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: So, okay.
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: So, then here's here's the maximum. Here's what we do. Here's what happens if we're able to max it out every year. And we're going to roll to uh All right. So, you can see right away, year one, we've got about $5,000 and a little bit more death benefit.
 
 
00:27:20
 
Andrew Daniels: Year 10, now we're at 70 instead of 25. And we're already at 200. Only 10 years in. We don't have to wait till age 70, right?
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm. Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: And then if we go to age 70, where does it get by retirement time? Uh 300 thou. So we've tripled the amount of cash and we've over like five times your death benefit.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm. Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: If if you were to try and get this kind of death benefit at this age, traditionally with just a regular policy, it would cost you way more than this and you would not have access to this level of cash. It would just it would be it would flatline for about the first seven years.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: There'd be zero dollars of cash.
Liz Wiltsie: Right. Right.
Andrew Daniels: So my opinion is that if somebody wants to get a lot of death benefit and have increasing death benefit, the best way to do it is to do it this way. And when I work with families with young kids, what I find is that they need access to the cash because it's expensive as all get out to have you have a lot of outflow for about 20 years.
 
 
00:28:31
 
Liz Wiltsie: Right. To have kids. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: But here's the cool thing that happens. after that 20 years is done, they kind of get launched and you know I'm under no delusion. I was calling my mom at 24 for help, right? So I always plan that like parents, I know.
Liz Wiltsie: Sir, I moved in with my mom at like 42. No. Right.
Andrew Daniels: So there there has to be some of that, but you know the amount of cash that can go into someone's policy then after the kids are launched that automatically increases. So, we kind of fill that bucket back up when they're in their later years before they're they're still working, but they don't have kids in the house and they're not yet ready to retire. That's where we get some of those um that's where this really starts to kind of blossom. So, yes, we can set it up so that there's more death benefit uh increasing. We can automatically increase that floor from a perspective of death benefit.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
 
 
00:29:27
 
Andrew Daniels: The other thing that we can do is we can say, okay, let's add where's my uh there it is. Let's add more. Let's bulk this term piece up.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: We may we may not fill up the sale completely, but I do have other people who their cash flow they can only put in an additional, you know, $10,000 a year of paid up additions, but it is very important to them to have that replacement for their children. So, we do a big bulky mast here and it's fairly cheap to do that.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: Maybe only cost them a hundred bucks a year and we get $500,000 of death benefit.
Liz Wiltsie: Oh, wow.
Andrew Daniels: So, you know, whatever that ratio is, it's it's it's pretty cheap.
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: And if we're if we're buying if we're interested and we need to we have a justifiable reason for buying more death benefit, doing it inside this policy is the most efficient way that you can do it.
Liz Wiltsie: Right. That makes sense. That makes sense.
 
 
00:30:25
 
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: That's a long answer to say yes, I can do that.
Liz Wiltsie: He was he was annoyed because the initial I think quote on the box right before he did his testing was like 50 bucks a month for like his term and um and then
Andrew Daniels: Uh yeah, yeah, yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: because of his stats it like doubled and he was like yo I'm annoyed. So, um, yeah. Okay, keep going.
Andrew Daniels: No, no, no worries.
Liz Wiltsie: Tell me more things.
Andrew Daniels: Um that is a good question. I think questions like that kind of help you get your bearings around how the policy works and No, that's good.
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Um so, okay. So, I wanted to show you on the midpoint, right? This is assuming we can't do anything better. And really what you can do is just stick this midpoint in your brain and and just know that anything we're able to do extra is just going to either uh it will increase this part quicker and it will
 
 
00:31:16
 
Liz Wiltsie: Yep.
Andrew Daniels: increase some of the um I guess milestones. We'll get to the milestones a little quicker.
Liz Wiltsie: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: So let me talk about one of the first milestones that I look for of like how do we make this really good for you.
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah. Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: I want to see on this increase column right here.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: I am very very excited about this and this is totally totally within range year nine.
Liz Wiltsie: Right. Right.
Andrew Daniels: Now it feels like a long time right? Nine years but this this should come back.
Liz Wiltsie: I mean, not really, but Wow.
Andrew Daniels: Uh, let me see if we what? Uh, yeah, here we go. Oh, yeah. Look at this. So, if we if we max it out with the 7,000, look look what year we get to that turnover point.
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: So, why is that important? Why is it so important? Because look at look at what happens.
 
 
00:32:24
 
Andrew Daniels: And I just every time I do this, I love it so much because it's it's a neat math trick. you're putting in 3,85 and let's say that's all you're ever able to do. Well, in this case, if you're not able to do anything extra after year 9, you put in 3,85, you get back out 3,087. All right. Well, maybe most people aren't jumping in that at that uh investment opportunity. But if we take 387 and divide out the, you know, find the percentage increase, that's a 100%. You get every dollar back available to you that year.
Liz Wiltsie: right?
Andrew Daniels: Do you know anywhere else you can put money in and get all your money back out other than a bank account? You can't put it in stocks, right?
Liz Wiltsie: Well, but also it's not growing at all because like if I take that out of stock, like yeah, I can take out what I put in. Maybe maybe and and if it grows, I'm paying capital gains on it,
Andrew Daniels: So, hopefully Yeah. Yeah.
 
 
00:33:23
 
Andrew Daniels: This is all going to be taxfree.
Liz Wiltsie: right? So like, yeah, I can take it. And and for me, I mean, I had a co last year. Um I did get into some quantum computing um at the right moment and I got out of it at the right moment. Um so um I did uh I did like double my money last year on that.
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Liz Wiltsie: Um, mind you, I didn't put in a s*** ton, but I did. I did. Uh, but also I needed it, right? And if I had needed it 3 weeks later, I would have been like completely, right?
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, it wouldn't. Yeah. Right. Right. We can't we can't duplicate that.
Liz Wiltsie: Um, no.
Andrew Daniels: We can't build a consistent on that.
Liz Wiltsie: No. And and like to be honest, it's bad like it's bad for me to try.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: Um, I have a um gambling thing. Um, I don't there was there was a time that I um my ex-husband and I played a lot of poker and we learned that we um don't make great choices.
 
 
00:34:19
 
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's a whole It's a whole thing. Okay. Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: So um I haven't done I mean gambled in that way um in 10 years 10 years.
Andrew Daniels: Right. Okay. Okay.
Liz Wiltsie: And so I'm always just really sensitive to like what feels like it to me and the like timing of the stuff.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: Like it's it's like so totally it's so totally the same.
Andrew Daniels: It's the It's the dopamine hits of like, am I going to get it? Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: It's so totally the same vibe. Um people who pretend it's not are lying to themselves.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you just think like some people live and breathe their whole lives and then they get themselves into like where the stakes are not you know I I I have a friend who you know played poker and I
Liz Wiltsie: Um
Andrew Daniels: my he never really acknowledged it which is you know it's kind of a sad thing but he does have a poker like addiction.
 
 
00:35:19
 
Andrew Daniels: he has a gambling addiction and he was constantly talking about how, you know, $200 or $300,000 and if he just did this tournament then he would be able to be back to zero. And I'm like, dude, just just take the loss and just walk away.
Liz Wiltsie: I mean it's it's it's and like when you see it right it is it's it's wild because I also we played uh like I met my ex-husband my ex-husband is a poker dealer I met him playing poker.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: We played poker five nights a week for four years.
Andrew Daniels: So it was he was doing it. All all the friends and relationships were doing.
Liz Wiltsie: Everyone's and there's nobody like we will off often talk about how like there just wasn't an adult in the room. Like there was nobody between the two of us. We were like, "Yeah, sounds like a good, you know, like sure, right?"
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Mary and I like that with each other. We're like, "Yeah, let's do it." Like, "Wait a minute. Hold
 
 
00:36:12
 
Liz Wiltsie: And so yeah, so I try really so like right now I did I like public.com the like stock um I like them.
Andrew Daniels: the phone. Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: I enjoy them. Um and they let you set up some like recurring stuff with kind of whatever combination of things you want. you can kind of create in some ways you can like create your own ETFs that way.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Oh, okay.
Liz Wiltsie: Umish.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: Um and so I did I do think that there is a um that there's a long kind of play in a quantum computing vibe, right?
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah. But it's a long and I agree. That's it's coming.
Liz Wiltsie: Um and so I am putting just a little bit there right now, but in a way that is like we're not timing this.
Andrew Daniels: We're not gonna stop it. Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: We're not anything.
Andrew Daniels: You're putting it into Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: If we need it, we're taking it out. It's like going whatever.
 
 
00:37:05
 
Liz Wiltsie: Um cuz their fees are also just really really low. Um which is nice. Um yeah, I like them. Uh and you can pay them 99 bucks a year and not pay any fees at all. Um, but if you do the like so you can pick up to 20 stocks in a recurring situation. Um, and you pay a 99 cent fee for that one transa that whole transaction.
Andrew Daniels: Oh, that's not terrible.
Liz Wiltsie: And so like I actually ran those numbers and I was like Liz, you actually don't need to pay them cuz like if you are investing every like two weeks, you you're actually saving like 60 bucks if you if
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: you don't pay them their 99 cent fee.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah. Well, see those are I mean I I like even it seems like such a small amount but like you know I actually in the last couple of years I I moved all of my clients from a custodian that they raise their fees almost every quarter for two years straight and I was I told everybody I was like hey when it when the time comes we're we're like jumping ship we can't it was just nuts.
 
 
00:38:12
 
Liz Wiltsie: No. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Some people have a little bit some people have a lot but it doesn't really matter.
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: We can't we can't have death by a thousand cuts.
Liz Wiltsie: Right. And you and you will, right? Those fees are bananas.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: Um, also, I did just look um like before I jumped on this call. I can um shift my 401k. Uh I I can get out of paying into it.
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Liz Wiltsie: Um so that is cool.
Andrew Daniels: So that what I do there what I do there is we kind of take that little bit and instead of you know for now that's not free cash flow that goes into this to your paid up additions.
Liz Wiltsie: Um so that is cool.
Andrew Daniels: What that does though is it gives you that access to it if you need it if you know if you need marketing or what we're going to use that we're going to start that little cash bucket for you.
Liz Wiltsie: Right. Right. Right.
 
 
00:39:05
 
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: So anyways, yeah, so um the the turnover point is really cool. If we go 15, if we go to the 15th year, right? So putting in what you get out, not super exciting, right? But just five years later, you can still only do the 3085 and now you get out 4,18. That's 130% increase at 58 years old. If most 58 year olds would say, "I would love 130% increase even on just $3,000."
Liz Wiltsie: Right. And like that 70 mark is bananas.
Andrew Daniels: Uhhuh. Yeah. Right here.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: So, what happens right here at 65? The term insurance uh nope, not yet. So, what happens here is the IRS rule is called the mech the MEC. It's called the mech limit. modified endowment contract. And just to give you an idea, when the policy ends at age 121, the term is that the contract has endowed. If you're trying to make if you're if you're trying to get cash before that point, then it's called a modified endowment contract.
 
 
00:40:10
 
Liz Wiltsie: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: So, we're trying to avoid that completely. And in order to do that, you have you are limited then at age 22, you're limited to how much you can put in. So they're going to rate they're going to they're going to take down the amount of premium that you can put in. But look at this. So uh and that's at 66. You put in 2,800 you get back you double your money that year.
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah, like yes, please. Let's do it.
Andrew Daniels: That's 197%. And then by the time you get to 70, right, it's even worse. Okay. But then what happens? So then we have a 30-year term on your policy. And I did that because you are so young. it makes sense to have as much as we it's not that much more expensive and the benefit from being able to put in more of the sale over that I want a longer period of time for you to
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: fund it with more money.
 
 
00:41:06
 
Andrew Daniels: So that's why longest term possible.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: Um, so then after that drops off, it drops off even well, okay, so I guess it's still you're still able to put some in. But look, so now at 76, you're only allowed to put in $1,613, but you get 7853 that year, right?
Liz Wiltsie: What a hardship.
Andrew Daniels: So you've got a uh you've got Where's my Oh, I Yeah. So that's a 486% increase. The challenge is it's only on $1,600, right? They start to they start to limit your your total amount that you can put in. Now, eventually at some point um those premiums do end entirely and at that point you just have straight income. Okay.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: So, now that you have the lay of the land for that and you understand why my goal is to get Whoops, don't go too far.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: My goal is to get this turnover point as early as possible. And your goal should be too.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: If we look at the maximum, if we're able to run, it doesn't even matter if you have to take all of it back out.
 
 
00:42:14
 
Andrew Daniels: You just have to get it past the gate. If you get it in there and you end up having to take it all back out for cash flow, I don't care because we'll make it back up later.
Liz Wiltsie: Right. Right.
Andrew Daniels: You can get that turnover point at year five, right?
Liz Wiltsie: Right. Then we Right.
Andrew Daniels: I mean then look at 53 you put in seven and you get out 88. You put in seven and you get out 11 and you're only 58 years old at that point.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: That's why this cash value grows so dramatically faster. And it's al it's also why the death benefit grows because every time you do that paid up addition oh I just closed it.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: Every time you do the paid up addition it grows the death benefit in addition to the cash value. So, we're also we're also kind of doing this with a game plan that you will eventually die and we'd like you to have a higher amount of death benefit when you do than when you started.
 
 
00:42:57
 
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm. Right. Right, right, right, right.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. So, does that kind of give you the lay of the land and the context?
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: And I think it really kind of frames yes, having the policy is really important. I think anybody that has one of these is automatically going to be better off because it it inherently sets the floor and raises the floor even if you can only do the bare minimums.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: If we use it then that is a whole then we get more beyond even these maximums. So one of the things that we can do let's say that you let's say um I'm trying to come up with like kind of a realistic scenario. Let's say over the next five years you're able to fund this completely and you don't really need you don't really need to take it back out maybe right you use the extra grow your business starts kind of funding
Liz Wiltsie: All right.
Andrew Daniels: itself you don't really need to touch this um maybe that's maybe that will happen maybe it won't we'll have to see what happens right soon as we get a significant amount of money in here what we do is
 
 
00:44:02
 
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: we take that out of the policy via a policy loan and we go and we send we send those dollars out of your warehouse to go bring in more money.
Liz Wiltsie: Right. You were telling me about that.
Andrew Daniels: And so as soon as possible, as soon as it's feasible with your lifestyle and how you want to use your cash flow because I think I'm going to reserve the priority, if you if we're, you know, if we're two years in and you need the money, let's like use it, right? Especially for business, you will always make more money.
Liz Wiltsie: right?
Andrew Daniels: And the return on investment in a business that you own, that you control, is always going to be the best investment. Even if it doesn't make money, the lessons you learn from it are still super valuable and help people financially. So, but this is cool because once we're able to take some out and uh how to show how to show there we go. Let's see. Does that show up or I I just have the wind.
 
 
00:45:04
 
Liz Wiltsie: No. Right.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Give me a second. I switch the uh switch the sharing here. This is the last piece I think I have that's really cool. And just to give you kind of the the you know maybe the 10-year look ahead of what what we're going to be doing. Um entire why don't we just do the entire screen. There we go. Okay. So uh in this example, this calculator here uh the one on the top left shows the effect of kind of a monthly premium payment. And we've got, you know, insurance policy rates. It's probably higher than this. Now, uh with the interest rate environment, a lot of the growth is about four to 5% inside the policy. Um, but over a 10-year period, let's just say that it brings up about $110,000. If we take that same amount out and we go get an outside interest rate, now I know that the highest interest rate I can get paid monthly is 8%.
Liz Wiltsie: Okay.
 
 
00:46:05
 
Andrew Daniels: But one of the things that people are concerned about is, well, don't I owe policy loan interest to the company? Yes, you do.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: If we take that out of your warehouse and we go and send it out to go make money, not only do you have an asset out there that's kicking off income, uh we're going to take a percentage of that income. So instead of 8%, let's say it's six and a half just because we're going to take that little one and a half percent and say that's what covers the policy loan interest.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: So somebody else is gonna pay for that, not you.
Liz Wiltsie: Right. Right.
Andrew Daniels: Either way, if you get to walk away with six and a half%, that's an additional $137,000 generated outside the policy. And remember, exactly.
Liz Wiltsie: Okay. So, this is in. So, then we would have what? Like 240 or something. Are we adding these two numbers? Oh, there we go.
Andrew Daniels: Add them together.
 
 
00:46:56
 
Andrew Daniels: We got the 249, right?
Liz Wiltsie: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: So, the impact of having money in your warehouse that grows whether you take it out or not.
Liz Wiltsie: So, we're making money on it twice.
Andrew Daniels: Ah, yes.
Liz Wiltsie: Okay, got it.
Andrew Daniels: And look, look what happens. Look what return you get.
Liz Wiltsie: Right. So, the idea is we can use it twice, but we can also make money on it twice, right?
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: Like, so when we need it, we can use it.
Andrew Daniels: Yes. Yes. And the way the way that you actually bring that full circle is you put on your banker hat and you play that game yourself and you say, "Okay, you know, you say, "Okay, Liz, I need a uh I
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah. Right.
Andrew Daniels: need $5,000." and you say to yourself, "How much do I charge myself for $5,000?"
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: Don't be nuts. Don't be a Don't be a greedy baker. You have to charge yourself 30%.
 
 
00:47:42
 
Andrew Daniels: Charge yourself what anybody else might charge you. You know, 8% 5% you whatever.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: As long as you've got something that you put back into the policy, then you're going to be okay. And here's here's where this really makes a lot of sense. Um, if you Oh, let me do a loan calculator here. Yep. This is what I want. So, if you take $5,000 and let's say you're being really nice to yourself and you're only going to charge yourself 4%, right? Um, and let's say you do it over a fiveyear period, that's going to mean that you put $928 back into your policy kind of on top of what you already do normally as pay yourself back.
Liz Wiltsie: Right. Right. Right.
Andrew Daniels: And you kind of already do this where you loan yourself money to your business.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: We're just going to give you kind of a multiplier in the back end with the policy.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: All right. Look what happens though.
 
 
00:48:35
 
Andrew Daniels: You're gonna end up if you complete that payment schedule, you only took $5,000 out of the policy. So once you hit 5,000, where does this extra $524 go? You can't you can't put it in the policy loan.
Liz Wiltsie: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: You paid that off paid up additions.
Liz Wiltsie: Right. So, back into the Ah, okay.
Andrew Daniels: Oops. back into the paid up additions where it then expands your capital base.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm. That makes sense, right?
Andrew Daniels: So it goes it goes back here. So every time you take money from yourself, you can grow your policy and your capital base, right?
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: And the way I think the best way to um bring this home, you can do this whole strategy with just a savings account.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: You can say, "Okay, I have a savings account. I got $5,000. I took $5,000 out. I'm gonna pay myself $5,000 plus a little bit of interest so that at the end I have 5,524. The problem is if you do it through a savings account, they won't credit you the interest on the 5,000 while you're using it and paying it back.
 
 
00:49:30
 
Liz Wiltsie: Right, right, right, right, right.
Andrew Daniels: So, this is like the ultimate way to get the most amount of of cover the most amount of ground with the effort that you have to put in either way. You're gonna have to put $5,000 back into your own pocket.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: No matter what, no matter what instrument you use, this just lets it grow while you're doing it.
Liz Wiltsie: Right. So the so the answer to the sort of retirement question is the it's there we take it out we make it work in another context and then it does a thing.
Andrew Daniels: Yes, exactly. Yep.
Liz Wiltsie: Um, cool.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. And at at retirement what a lot of times what I'll do is we'll say okay you know you want to retire at 68 or whatever we will illustrate we can do a couple of things we can illustrate an income off of this just straight from the policy great let's take whatever whatever it's growing and the calculators will do this and say how much can we get from this policy over the next 25 years and we'll just start taking income through policy loans with no intention of ever paying them back which is fine because they will just take that out of the death benefit at the end.
 
 
00:50:43
 
Liz Wiltsie: Right, right, right, right.
Andrew Daniels: And you can see the loan doesn't change the underlying mechanics here. The death benefit's still going to increase. The cash value is going to increase. If you you know, and I have people in their 60s and 70s, hey, when can I stop paying premiums? Do I have to put $6,740? You know, I'm 73 years old. Do I have to put $6,700 in? I don't know. If you do, you'll get 22,000. Do you not want to put $6,700 in?
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: And most people are like, "Oh, yeah. I'm
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: gonna do that all day." Right.
Liz Wiltsie: Never mind. Never mind. Yeah, we're good.
Andrew Daniels: Right. So, um, we can do that, but my preferred strategy is to is to stick with this um to stick with this, right?
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: Even in retirement, we can let it grow while it's here.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: We can take it out and get something somewhere else.
 
 
00:51:38
 
Andrew Daniels: And with the extra, you can put it back.
Liz Wiltsie: Great.
Andrew Daniels: The strategy is income, liquidity, and then legacy. So, with income, what we're going to do, and I'll remind you of this 30 years from now. I promise. We're going to take that, we're going to take the money that you've that you've built up, and we're going to say, "Okay, you know, we're 68 years old. We've got 268 $260,000. Let's take 150 of that, and let's go put it into a product that will guarantee income for life at a higher withdrawal rate than the 4% rule.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: And I don't know if you've heard of the 4 percent rule.
Liz Wiltsie: I have Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: And so most people are like, "Well, I need a million dollars because at 4% that get me $40,000 a year."
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: Right.
Liz Wiltsie: Right. And honestly, most of us need more than that.
Andrew Daniels: Well, yes.
Liz Wiltsie: But keep going.
Andrew Daniels: Right.
 
 
00:52:26
 
Andrew Daniels: We absolutely do. I'm with you.
Liz Wiltsie: I mean, you five kids that you got, like, what you talking about?
Andrew Daniels: I'm not going to retire.
Liz Wiltsie: $40,000. Like I'm like I'm going to need to die and like be like, "Okay, we're done. The
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. So, if we at a million, right? Yeah. I'm just gonna Yeah, that'll be it. Yeah, if the equation is 04 times your principal, right, you get 40 uh Whoops.
Liz Wiltsie: end." There
Andrew Daniels: You get $40,000 a year. 0.04 times your principal.
Liz Wiltsie: you go.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Okay, maybe that's great, but it's kind of hard to build up to a million dollars.
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: And everybody thinks that they can't adjust that percentage.
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: The reason is that those percentages are based on the probabilities in the stock market.
Liz Wiltsie: The stock market.
Andrew Daniels: So when you don't know if things are going up or down, you you have to do it statistically when you are retirement age.
 
 
00:53:10
 
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: And I'm currently doing this with clients who are in their 60s and 70s. We're going to that and we're going to use the actuarial science of how long people live and that gets us a different rate.
Liz Wiltsie: Right. Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: So I have a lady who she's a doctor. She was convinced I need a million dollars. I have to have a million dollars. And I said, "Okay, well what do you She had maybe three or 400,000 to start and it's just but she is behind for being a doctor. Um but we were able to take 200,000 and she got a 12% withdrawal rate because she was 68 and they think oh you're going to die sooner so we'll give you more money quicker. Right?
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: So that's 24 grand a year.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: Other people who are doctors who are going to get a $24,000 a year income stream if they are in the stock market and they have to follow the 4% rule would need $600,000.
 
 
00:54:10
 
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: So she's going to live a lifestyle.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: She's going to have income at the lifestyle of someone who saved $600,000.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: So, that is my preferred method to, you know, yes, we're going to accumulate whatever we accumulate in your policy, but that's not the end of the story because when you're ready to retire, we're going to go get a multiplier on the amount of capital that you saved. We're going to get that effectively by the amount of income that we can bring into your life at that point. And that that's where it comes full circle.
Liz Wiltsie: What do these numbers look like? If I want the max to be like 10 in a year, you're good.
Andrew Daniels: Um, okay. Let me see if Oh, I got logged out. Let me see if I can Let me see if I can do that real fast here. Uh, but I gotta log in because we were talking.
Liz Wiltsie: I know. We got to log out.
 
 
00:55:02
 
Liz Wiltsie: Log in all the time.
Andrew Daniels: Oh my gosh. I just wish there was a way to have a persistent state.
Liz Wiltsie: They want you to be safe or whatever.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's only because it's costing them a lot of money for fraud.
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Um, so you said the max would be 10. I'm I will show you I'll show you kind of a quick and a rough uh a rough number, but if that's what we go with, just know that I'll probably go in there and I'll tweak and optimize to make sure that I can get it turned over as quickly as possible.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: Uh, the good news is I can generally I can generally kind of copy what I've already done. So, I can probably do this pretty quick. Give me two seconds.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: We'll just run it right here. See which one I got. Oh.
Liz Wiltsie: Oh, we are in an infinite loop.
Andrew Daniels: Oh, yep.
 
 
00:55:57
 
Andrew Daniels: Whoops. Sorry. I was trying to I I got I only have two screens and I really think I need a third screen, but my graphics card doesn't uh doesn't allow for that. Okay, so that's okay. Oh, it's because I'm still screen sharing. It would be helpful if I labeled um these cases. I think I'm realizing right now. It's always Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: like I could have some efficiency in this maybe
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Let's see if this is the right one. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Okay. We'll just do that one. And you said uh 10,000 for the total.
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah, like on the high end, right?
Andrew Daniels: Okay. like the max. Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: The max.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: So, we go to uh premium. There we go. Okay. Pull that. I should be able to copy. There we go. Got it. Got it.
 
 
00:57:29
 
Andrew Daniels: Got it. Sorry. I just got to do a little manual entry here. That way I'm That way I make sure we're looking at apples. Apples and apples here.
Liz Wiltsie: There you go.
Andrew Daniels: If I If I run the calculator like from scratch, it's not going to be the exact same number. So that that'll kind of throw off the uh Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: The comparison.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. So let's try to keep it uh keep it steady here.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. And then we'll put this guy in. 49750. There we go. All right. Stopping 30 specified amount. Okay. So, that's where I need to adjust. We're going to go up to 10,000. Right now, the maximum is 7400. So, if we give it a Uh oh.
Liz Wiltsie: I thought it was 69.
Andrew Daniels: Um interesting thing on so it is so this is kind of cool too. Um it grow that maximum is actually calculated it's not a fixed maximum it's calculated on a rolling basis based on the premiums you pay in. So it's kind of like the more you put in that maximum creeps up higher and higher.
 
 
00:58:47
 
Andrew Daniels: So, yes, the maximum uh on the midpoint plan was probably 69. Yeah, see 6805. Oh, can you see that?
Liz Wiltsie: Okay. Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: That looks really uh looks really teenytiny.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: So, 68 on the midpoint plan. But if we switch back over to the one where we assume that you fund, you know, fund it maximum, then your maximum actually grows to 74 with we don't and that's not anything we even have to request.
Liz Wiltsie: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: Does that make sense how that top lever is kind of it's kind of attached to whatever it is you're able to do during the plan.
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: So, um, yeah. Sorry. That's I just I I kind of like that because like you're not required to use it, but if you do, you actually get a little bit of a reward.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, so we're going to do 10,000 raise LPA premiums to make. Okay, this should Oh, one more thing. We don't want it to be taxable. Please, no taxes.
 
 
00:59:49
 
Andrew Daniels: And I should I should qualify. The IRS won't consider it tax-free. What they do is they say, "Well, it's first in first out." So when you take money out of the policy, the way they tax it, all the money that you've ever contributed, your basis, you get to withdraw that first. So you might be 99 before you ever get out of your basis because those premiums are going for 30 years.
Liz Wiltsie: Uh. Mhm. Right.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, let's see. I think that this 244. No, that didn't work. Uh see where exactly and so right and so that's the other they don't Yes that's the other benefit is that they won't uh oh I see what's happened here level premium ah
Liz Wiltsie: Well, and technically with policy loans, we're not taking anything out, right? So, it's not Okay. Yeah, I'm with you. I'm with you. Okay. Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: almost there was almost there $10,000 and All right, it's thinking.
Liz Wiltsie: Sure. As one does.
 
 
01:01:01
 
Andrew Daniels: Hang on. There we go. Need that number. All right, that's the number I needed. And one more. One more little pass. I'm trying to do it quickly. I mean, and I'll I'll spend I'll spend a lot of time on this um before I uh before I submit it because I really I'm very focused on making sure that we get as much cash that you can use today and in the early years of the policy as possible. Um, so I will, if if this is what we go with, I will tweak it even further to make it look on paper like you're going to do nothing, but give you the option to do everything.
Liz Wiltsie: Right. Right. Right.
Andrew Daniels: And I I I mean, I guess however they do their process, I guess it works for them because I've been submitting policies like this for 10 years, and they've never said, "Hey, Andy, none of your clients look like
Liz Wiltsie: Which is helpful.
Andrew Daniels: they're going to pay a lot." And
 
 
01:02:01
 
Andrew Daniels: then they all end up doing a whole lot more than planned, but I guess they have a process for it. So, okay, here we go. I have an additional. All right. So, we're gonna look. Do you want to compare the the maximum of the 7,000 to the 10,000 or do you want to compare the midpoint?
Liz Wiltsie: uh Max.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. So, we'll look at both the maxes.
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. And I did label I did actually label this file. So we're not gonna get lost here. All right. I'll see if I can put both of these side by side. Uh can you see it if I make it do a split screen?
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: Not that kind of split screen. Holy cow.
Liz Wiltsie: Supuff.
Andrew Daniels: There we go. All right. All right. And we get back to here. One, two, three. Okay. I think that's about Yeah.
 
 
01:03:10
 
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah, perfect.
Andrew Daniels: So, okay. So, 69.86 on our previous maximum, 10,000 on our new maximum.
Liz Wiltsie: Yep.
Andrew Daniels: Um, and then we can just kind of compare the cash value.
Liz Wiltsie: Yep.
Andrew Daniels: Uh, oh god, get out of here. AI assistant. I don't want to pay for your AI. Okay. Um, so yeah, I mean we've got, you know, and these are these are in fiveyear increments here. So 47 I mean it that definitely look at this four years. We get our turnover point in four years with that. That's really cool. I mean the other turnover points in the fifth year, but this I mean this goes way over in the fourth year.
Liz Wiltsie: I mean, I would love to run it at that 10 and see and just tell me what that ends up. I mean, obviously, you're going to do your finessing, right?
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, I mean that that helps. It helps right away. Like that is that's Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: But then I also like the idea of if right because I'm looking at um you know putting the Apple money in right away cuz if I can put the Apple money in twice in the next year right which would be the assumption and then put my 401k money in not the right the what I pay monthly um that probably hits it or it It's damn close, right?
 
 
01:04:32
 
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, that probably that probably does cover about that much. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's true.
Liz Wiltsie: Um and so, um and that all of that I can do without um impacting money that I that I'm already right without actually coming out of pocket uh quote the pockets that
Andrew Daniels: That's true. It's not really dependent. Yeah, exactly.
Liz Wiltsie: you know. Anyway, I understand that it is all actually technically out of pocket, but it doesn't feel that way cuz I have a very significant like delusion going on right now.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: But it's fine.
Andrew Daniels: 10 six. Okay. Yeah. So, 10 years in, you know. Yeah. I mean, it does. You're gonna get a lot more growth a lot quicker on that number.
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: That I mean, that's just that is what it is.
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: It really is. That's And then I mean, if you just did that, that's you know, $500,000 at age 70 if you if we keep that up.
 
 
01:05:37
 
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: And so, you know, if that's where the target is.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: Now the good news is I believe so if we look at and of course yeah
Liz Wiltsie: Like I still think if you do your sort of magic around the minimums and stuff um that is helpful, you know, just in case per your larger point there. Um yeah, like look at that.
Andrew Daniels: I'm just double checking. Yeah. Yeah. So we want to set we want to make sure that there's availability. Oh this is where we look at this. Okay. Oh, let's see.
Liz Wiltsie: That's banana. B A N A N A S bananas.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah. And you know, of course, there's a lot there's I think probably to keep it simple, this this analysis or this uh this here is is good. I'll see what I can do. Um I got to make sure it's correct before we make a decision. Let's do that. Um, but yeah, I think the a good rule of thumb is just, you know, the more the more you put in, the more you get out.
 
 
01:06:46
 
Andrew Daniels: The ratios don't change because those the rate of how things work is based on your health rating. So, right, that's not going to change other than the fact that there is kind of like this upper or this like minimum limit of when that base is at a certain spot, then I can piggy back up off
Liz Wiltsie: Damn.
Andrew Daniels: of that. And so I'm not changing the base on that at all.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: So that's the other thing that's cool too is that we can we can kind of keep going with this.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: Um, so okay. So you want me to kind of optimize on the allowance for the 10K as the max. And it it may even work out that that max goes a little bit higher without having to change the underlying bare minimum, which if I can do that, I will because you're a business owner. I expect you to be good and like make money. I expect you to go well.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm. Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: Um, and then we'll leave the stop gap.
 
 
01:07:36
 
Andrew Daniels: So, if it doesn't happen, no big deal. It's not going to kill you if it doesn't happen.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm. Mhm. Perfect.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Uh, any other questions? That was quite a lot.
Liz Wiltsie: No, I think we're good. We're good. like do your thing and then let me know.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Okay. Um, so really they are they are ready. Um, they're ready for us and they're kind of just waiting for us to get this part figured out.
Liz Wiltsie: Great.
Andrew Daniels: Um, and so I'll kind of combobulate it and um, I will turn everything into an a monthly well, how do you want to see it?
Liz Wiltsie: Perfect.
Andrew Daniels: Do you want to do it monthly or because they the premium options are monthly, quarterly, semianual, or annual? And so does it make sense for us to set it up on a semianual basis?
Liz Wiltsie: I think so. But let's like um what would really make the most sense at least the thing that um will work in the most reasonable cadence and let me pretend that nothing is new is happening is right is
 
 
01:08:26
 
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Right. Out of sight, out of mind. Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: semianual plus monthly right because then that apple stock goes in twice a year And the 401k comes out monthly, right?
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Yeah. Okay. I see. All right.
Liz Wiltsie: I mean, like technically not because technically it's every two weeks, but it does that doesn't that doesn't matter.
Andrew Daniels: So, yeah, it fits within your framework of doing your monthly budget.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: So, what's the total amount of the 401k? Hold on. I do have that, don't I? I think you already because now now we're just now we're just pulling levers to get kind of the administrative piece set up.
Liz Wiltsie: Uh let me let me doublech check that real fast. Mhm. Let me double check where we where we at. Of course, Apple's another one that like you have to two factor authenticate every like 30 seconds with them.
Andrew Daniels: We noticed you're in a different location.
 
 
01:09:40
 
Liz Wiltsie: So, wow.
Andrew Daniels: You have been locked out for 48 hours. Uh, what is the uh the new one? No, I I just had to go get my phone. Um, oh, I cracked it and everything. So, I did a Apple Care thing and uh I forgot to turn off the the thing that if you're in a new location, you can't undo Find My iPhone.
Liz Wiltsie: Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep.
Andrew Daniels: So, I had like scheduled appointment and everything and then I got there and like, "Yeah, well, you gotta come back."
Liz Wiltsie: Yep.
Andrew Daniels: I was like, "Shoot. No,
Liz Wiltsie: I mean, except they shouldn't because did you not know your password or did you know your password?
Andrew Daniels: I did I did know my password and everything.
Liz Wiltsie: So then they're not skilled at what they're doing because you can just for your knowledge base in the future. Um, if you go into your Find My app itself, um, then even if you've got stolen device protection on, which obviously when you're at home, I would turn it off because it's a pain in the ass and most
 
 
01:10:30
 
Andrew Daniels: Uhhuh.
Liz Wiltsie: people have more problem remembering their password than they do um than corre than right than they do uh having it stolen, right?
Andrew Daniels: losing their device. Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: It's more I lost it in my own damn house, right?
Andrew Daniels: Oh,
Liz Wiltsie: Um and uh okay, pre-tax deductions. There we go. Okay. Um one, so this last paycheck. So that that last paycheck I worked a little more than one might have wanted. So let's do a let's do a a better let's do the low end of this. Hold on. Um so uh this last one that's more on the on the low end of things is 113. uh in my in my two week paycheck. So 250ish um 250 is fine.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Okay.
Liz Wiltsie: I'm happy with 250. Um right.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Yeah. And it'll be just a one to one. You'll just stop that and send Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: Right. Which is perfect. So um yeah.
 
 
01:11:41
 
Liz Wiltsie: Okay. So, if you go into your Find My app, um, and then you click on devices and then you click on like your phone or whatever, um, then at the bottom of that little menu is um is a spot that says remove this device. And so if you are in the Apple store, it will let and what you what happens then is you put in your Apple ID password and then it'll mark it for repair or trade in. It technically doesn't remove
Andrew Daniels: Oh. Uhhuh. Oh, allows the support.
Liz Wiltsie: it because you've got that stolen device protection on, but and so your Apple Store people, no bu no bueno.
Andrew Daniels: Uh, they didn't even No, they were just like this you you should have off.
Liz Wiltsie: No bueno. Obviously, if you had forgotten your password and you're not on your home Wi-Fi, you you've got an hour security delay and whatever, right?
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: Um, but no, you can. So, like when I'm doing it with people, I just go straight there all the time now because then it just it does it regardless because also if you're setting up a new phone, the default button it wants you
 
 
01:12:45
 
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Don't listen. Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: to push is that stolen device protection.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: When And so when I'm helping people set up phones, I'm like, actually, yeah, right.
Andrew Daniels: And they make it they make it sound scary like yeah I want stolen.
Liz Wiltsie: And you're like, actually, no.
Andrew Daniels: Don't do that.
Liz Wiltsie: No. um it makes it real hard and and you know because obviously we are overindexed in our Apple store on like old people who like also just don't know how right so they've they've forgotten their password they can't
Andrew Daniels: It'll make your life really complicated. Yeah. Oh yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: reset it they're mad at us because there's no back door to reset that right like we and you don't want us to have one the amount of time I explain that to people is another thing right you don't
Andrew Daniels: Right. No. Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: want to I like I know you're frustrated ated and also you don't want us to have that back door.
 
 
01:13:35
 
Andrew Daniels: If you want back doors, go get a Google phone. Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: So anyway, that's how you would do it moving forward.
Andrew Daniels: Oh, that's good to know.
Liz Wiltsie: That is how you would do it.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. I just I live I live like 20 minutes away, so I was like, I'll just go home and come back.
Liz Wiltsie: So sure and you'll come back, right? But you can also be like, "Hey, um I heard this is how you do this."
Andrew Daniels: Are you sure? Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: And then maybe There you go.
Andrew Daniels: Well, I got I got a I got an Otterbox, too. So, hopefully my my hopefully I don't crack any more screen.
Liz Wiltsie: So the the company that I like most is called tech21 um at teec21.com.
Andrew Daniels: Oh, okay.
Liz Wiltsie: So like this is my this is they are rated for um 16 ft of dropping and I've had a tech 21 case.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Is the Is the camera are the cameras covered on that one?
 
 
01:14:29
 
Liz Wiltsie: So it's not covered. It just has a lip which like you don't want to cover the camera because yeah, you're putting I tell people all the time have like the you know $5 covers on their camera and I'm like yo you just
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Okay. Okay. Right. It'll distort and glare. Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: put a 10-centent piece of glass like piece of plastic over a very advanced camera situation and you're wondering why your pictures aren't any good.
Andrew Daniels: I'm like a really advanced camera. Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: Like hello.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: But yes, I would take a Tech2 21 like every day of the week, twice on Sunday.
Andrew Daniels: 21. Yeah, that's awesome.
Liz Wiltsie: I think they're um they have saved my I drop my phone all the time. And um I have not broken one with a Tech2 case. So yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Well, yeah, I was just I was like I didn't I was walking out and I was like just give me something because I don't even want to leave the store without it protected.
 
 
01:15:20
 
Liz Wiltsie: Yep. Yep. Order it on the internet. Order it on the internet.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: Uh yeah, I think we're we're great.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, perfect.
Liz Wiltsie: Send me what you got when you got it.
Andrew Daniels: All questions, you're you're probably going to come up with some more questions, but let me uh let me combabulate this and um so I'll get the new numbers and then I'll send you a um uh you'll get the
Liz Wiltsie: And thingy thing.
Andrew Daniels: illustration.
Liz Wiltsie: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: You once they activate the policy, they'll send me a whole policy packet.
Liz Wiltsie: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: I used to have and I don't have one here, but they'll send me a whole packet. I'll prepare it and I'll have to mail it to you with and there'll be some friends that you got to send back and then the illustration you'll see what I submit and you know just keep in the back
Liz Wiltsie: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: of your mind. It's going to look way different because I want to submit to them only the bare minimum but I'm going to buried deep in there are the maximum limits and so I'm not going to show them that we're going
Liz Wiltsie: It's going to change. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: to max it out because I don't want them to charge you that upfront.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: We're going to leave it optional.
Liz Wiltsie: Right.
Andrew Daniels: We'll target the monthly premium of the 257 or whatever and there'll be a um a d bank draft withdrawal form that I'll send to you probably electronically for that.
Liz Wiltsie: Yep. Yep.
Andrew Daniels: Um you will have the option then um we don't have to tell them when you're going to do the Apple stock you when you're going to do that.
Liz Wiltsie: Okay. Right.
Andrew Daniels: You can just do that and you can go to your online portal and have that sent in. Um yeah.
Liz Wiltsie: And do it. Okay.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. So then you'll have flexibility to do it whenever you want.
Liz Wiltsie: Okay. Wonderful.

Cheri M and Melissa S - Financial Strategy Review - Transcript
00:00:00
 
Cheri M.: where they're standing up. I can't hear. Is your mic on? I can't hear you.
Andrew Daniels: Let's see. Now it is. Good call. I'm sorry. I realized you guys aren't on you weren't on the calendar invite. So, I added it to the invite, but then you guys wouldn't have known about it. So, this technology is keeping us on our toes. Um, okay. Hey, how are you guys doing?
Cheri M.: We're okay.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, just just making it right. Well, we're gonna we want to we want to raise the level of that so that you guys are uh feeling great all the time. Um okay. Yeah. Do what?
Cheri M.: I said, "Give me some of that G. I have been
Andrew Daniels: We've got it. I'm excited for you. I think we got we're starting to get the pieces put to put together and um I wanted to start off. Are you getting uh the monthly notifications from directed IRA about the deposits that HomePath is making?
 
 
00:04:28
 
Cheri M.: there was a time that I couldn't log in and I know Sherry mentioned that to you and then when I follow and when I clicked on the link and it was I was able to log in. So I
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Cheri M.: don't know if they were having some issues or something.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Yeah, that's great.
Cheri M.: Yes.
Andrew Daniels: So, so far we've had four four payments. Um, the first one was just a shorter payment of 87 or $83, but then it's been$1 193.88 every month and that's going to continue for the next five years. So, you're already $600 up on your 29,000.
Cheri M.: Go ahead.
Andrew Daniels: And, um, so, um, that is good. I just want to make sure that you have, uh, you got access to that. So, that's good. Um, let me see here. pull up my notes here and I'm getting our uh analyzer up. I just like to have that ready to roll. So, okay. So, yeah. So, this is great that we're taking time.
 
 
00:05:19
 
Andrew Daniels: I think the purpose of today is we just want to make sure that um you're totally clear on what the next like we're going to we're going to layer these strategies one on top of the other. So, now that we've got the secured note in place and you can see how it deposits every month into the cash account of the IRA, now we now we want to do the next layer and start another machine
Cheri M.: Mhm. Right.
Andrew Daniels: that kicks off income on top of that.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: Um, and so, you know, now that we have that foundation, the note pays month after month, you know, you've got great instincts. Um, and we're going to build something. We're going to build this on something that's now solid and tangible. like you know that money's coming in. So now we can build off of that.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: Um okay. So we want to take that it's already working that 190 a month. What are we going to do with that? We're going to hopefully today we can get an amount that we can get the policy started.
 
 
00:06:12
 
Andrew Daniels: It's been hanging out there for a while and I keep calling them being like we're going to figure it out. She's going to take it. We just have to get the numbers correct. Um yes.
Cheri M.: That's why you had question about Yes.
Andrew Daniels: Um to do that we're going to need to do a new application page because it was quite a while ago that we did that. So, they just want an applica, just one single page that has an updated date and signature. And then they're going to want a draft form. Uh, basically you you decide what date you want them to draft the premium and we can send that all into them. So, um, all right.
Cheri M.: And that's forms I have, right? Those are the forms.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: Yes. Yeah. So, right off the bat, what questions do you have?
Cheri M.: um just kind of go back over and explain to me how it works and how the how the flow of everything works because I know the last time we talked you talked about like whatever I put in there
 
 
00:06:55
 
Andrew Daniels: Mhm.
Cheri M.: if I wanted it the next day or if I needed it the next day I would have access to it. uh just kind of wanting to know how all of that works and and and I know that you mentioned also what's going in home path that if we wanted to we could route that into the insurance also. But if we routed that into the insurance, how is it still making money? That doesn't make any sense to me. Especially if it's available for me to take out because if I take something out, I don't understand how it's making money. Does that make sense?
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yes. Absolutely. So, it sounds like you want to make sure you need some confidence in how do you keep your liquidity and flexibility with this entire setup and maybe some questions lingering because everybody feels this about at this stage.
Cheri M.: Correct.
Andrew Daniels: what goes up has to come down. Like these companies are clearly making money. How can it be this good of a deal for me and still be a good deal for them?
 
 
00:08:00
 
Cheri M.: Correct.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Um and then um probably another piece of it is you've had experiences in the past that you've been told one thing and it hasn't worked out and now you're like I don't have time for that kind of shenanigan anymore. So how are we going to make sure that this is absolutely going to work?
Cheri M.: This is true.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah.
Cheri M.: I know it's gonna work.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Um, and I'll just I'll just say this. First off, what you're going to get from Sherry and I is you're going to get our brains on your numbers regularly. We're not going to let it go two, three years before we look back and check in with you and re-evaluate, right? Um, at a minimum, our practice is that we every six months sit down and say, "Hey, is this still working for you? what
Cheri M.: All right.
Andrew Daniels: has come up that you feel like is either an opportunity or an emergency and then we want to work with you hand inand so that and I've had all kinds of things come up where um people have changed jobs they've moved across the country uh even within weeks of us getting our plan started and it it basically without somebody to um wrangle the bull in a lot of cases it could throw people off but here's the
 
 
00:09:15
 
Andrew Daniels: secret that we have the way that we set up this system is designed to handle those exact situations and not interrupt your growth of your funds. And there are some things that I'll get into that cover that. But you should know upfront, you're not just getting something that we all walk away from and go, great, Melissa set. She has no more support. What you're really getting from us that you probably could get another policy from somebody else. Um, but that I've seen in my experience, most people that that do this kind of planning, they're not going to be as involved as we are. Like when you say, "Hey, uh, you know, the car needs a new radiator. We got we need $2,000." Sherry and I go to work and we reorganize all your numbers and we come back to you say, "Here's where we get that. Here's how it's going to be okay. Here's how we make sure that you still have money for your vacation at the end of the year." That's
 
 
00:10:08
 
Cheri M.: Gotcha.
Andrew Daniels: what you're actually getting from us. I could care less what type of secured note or policy or investments we end up doing. That's less critical to me than having all of us be on your team to solve and resolve these problems in the most efficient way possible as they come up. Right? And so I just want to put that out there because I think it's going to be a little hard for me to cover all the situations that could possibly come up maybe to that level of satisfaction and I don't even think that's necessary for you. What you want to know is, do we have your back? And we absolutely do. We figure stuff out like this all the time.
Cheri M.: What did
Andrew Daniels: And we're going to build in some contingency because I've been doing this for a while. Life is going to happen. I never count on a plan of being able to execute exactly the way I say. But what I do count on is that we have that flexibility that when you need control and you need access that we absolutely will have it at every single corner.
 
 
00:11:03
 
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. So, back to the original questions. How does the whole thing work? And I'm going to address the uh the life insurance piece of it first, right?
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: The short answer is how are they making money and still allowing me to take it and all that stuff. The short answer is they plan for it. They It's part of their business practice that they allow it.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: The slightly longer answer that I think will satisfy that niggling feeling of but it has to make sense. The company sells all kinds of products to other customers that don't get to do this that you're going to get to do. And the profit from their products cover the cost of allowing you to do this. Not very many people ask for this. And so the company plans to allow the policy holders who ask for it upfront to be able to do it.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: Does that help close the loop?
Cheri M.: And and the home as well.
 
 
00:11:56
 
Cheri M.: She was wondering how the home path is going to pay for that premium and yet make money with home path at the same time as well.
Andrew Daniels: Well, okay. Here's here's where I think we have a fundamental we need to make sure we understand the fundamental difference between life insurance.
Cheri M.: He's loud.
Andrew Daniels: Oh, sorry. I'm just excited. Um the all the other insurance that you pay for is a black box. You s you pay that premium and you never you probably never see that money again. I mean when was the last time you filed a car insurance claim?
Cheri M.: Um, a couple about eight weeks ago.
Andrew Daniels: Oh my gosh. No way.
Cheri M.: Yeah. How many weeks ago? A limb fell on fell on Charlie's truck.
Andrew Daniels: And how much did they pay out for that? What was the total payout on that? A couple thousand dollars.
Cheri M.: That was probably like 800 bucks.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. $800.
Cheri M.: Yeah, basically.
 
 
00:12:56
 
Andrew Daniels: And you've you've had car insurance for your whole life, right?
Cheri M.: Yes, you got that right.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. And I'm guessing you have some mental calculus in your brain that says $800. Whoop-de-doo. I'm so glad I didn't have to pay it. But it doesn't come close to the amount of money that I've spent in my life on car insurance.
Cheri M.: I spent more money in six months.
Andrew Daniels: Right. Yeah. Yeah. I Yes. I don't want you those are it's not an applesto apples comparison. You've never experienced something like this in your life because it's just not it's not available to the average person. Life insurance is based on something that's guaranteed to happen. It's not a when it's not an if, it's a when. And that changes the financial nature of the product. They have to make sure that when we all die that if we have a death benefit, it gets paid out.
Cheri M.: Right.
Andrew Daniels: And what what happens on the policy is the very first month you make a premium, you know, let's say uh you know it's a $100, they might be on the hook for $50,000 and they've not had any time to take those premiums, invest them, grow them, whatever, right?
 
 
00:14:05
 
Andrew Daniels: That's a huge risk to the company and a giant benefit to you. As time goes by and you keep paying those premiums, they are able to credit cash value and grow the policy as an asset. Your car insurance policy, your home insurance polic, those are not considered assets. Those are just purely a just in case you can never access any of the cash that you put back into those policies ever for any reason. With your policy, there is a point where you will earn more in growth on the policy than you're allowed to put in that month, that year. And sometime around the 8year mark, you will forever be in a position where no matter how much you put into the policy up to the limit, you will always earn more than what you put in and you'll have access to that. Now, Well, hopefully not.
Cheri M.: might be dead years. Stop it.
Andrew Daniels: No, I don't think the company doesn't think so. They see they gave you a great rating, so we should make a plan for you to be alive for a while.
 
 
00:15:15
 
Andrew Daniels: Um, does that make sense though that this is not a black box? We're using the policy as a warehouse for your wealth, which means yes, you can just put it away and never touch it. You're going to gain so much more if we run money through it and then use it and deploy it as we go.
Cheri M.: All right. When you say run money through it, deploy it as we go, my understanding is that is if I put it in and take it back out. Is that what you're saying?
Andrew Daniels: Right.
Cheri M.: So, you're saying, and what's that process like?
Andrew Daniels: And so, uh, well, I mean, in your brain, give them time.
Cheri M.: And you say there's a hold a hold they put on it or something.
Andrew Daniels: Give the banking system some leeway. It takes time for a check or a payment to get processed and credited to the company's bank account. Similarly, when you go to request the money back out, it takes a few days for it to leave their bank account, travel through the wires, and then finally hit your bank account.
 
 
00:16:15
 
Andrew Daniels: So, we need to have some reasonable administrative time, but effectively you can take put money in and take it right back out. Um, what we are going Yeah.
Cheri M.: So within like a fiveday period basically.
Andrew Daniels: I would say three to five days is reasonable. Yeah.
Cheri M.: Yeah. Okay.
Andrew Daniels: What we're eventually going to do as this builds up is we're going to we're going to take money out of the policy and we're going to pay off all your credit cards.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: You are going to become the source of capital for the borrowing that you did with those credit cards and you are currently paying whatever interest you're paying to to buy their boats, right?
Cheri M.: Right.
Andrew Daniels: It doesn't take you off the hook for paying the interest because you already promised that interest to somebody.
Cheri M.: Right.
Andrew Daniels: But now that interest is going to go back into your pocket in the form of growing the available amount that you can take back from the policy.
Cheri M.: Gotcha.
Andrew Daniels: What it does is, and it's not going to be overnight, but over a couple of years, three to four years, that extra amount of capital inside your system that you have control of, that's going to go to support emergencies that come up.
 
 
00:17:24
 
Andrew Daniels: the things that you the things that you used to say, "Oh, I'm gonna put it on the credit card because there's not enough working capital." You're not going to do that as much over the next fiveyear period because you'll be able to take it from your future self. Quote marks, right?
Cheri M.: Sorry.
Andrew Daniels: And whatever interest you were going to pay to the credit card company, 22%, cut it to 7%. Pay yourself the extra amount or nothing at all in some cases. Right? and this is where you're going to work with us and we'll say, "Okay, we have this situation come up. We need to figure out what we're going to do." And we go, "Okay, here's the best way to do that where you can give yourself a break and maintain your cash flow." And you have to look at this little period here is we are bootstrapping this, right? Um, in that we have a short period of time just because of the stage of life that you're in. We have a short period of time that we have to get a lot of things reorganized, but it's not impossible.
 
 
00:18:19
 
Andrew Daniels: I've done it with other people who are almost in exactly yours, actually worse situation than you're in, right? Um, and so it's going to be tight and we're going to have to be probably really communicating on this is what goes where. The benefit to that is I'm hoping you can take our language and how we talk about things and then start to learn and adopt those practices, which I mean most people do within about a year or two they get it. So when we take money from the policy, um, what they're doing, a good analogy, but not quite the exact same thing, is it's almost like, you know, how people use like home equity line of credits on their houses.
Cheri M.: Yes.
Andrew Daniels: That is a similar process. We are actually leveraging the fact that your policy is an a whole asset just like your house, right? But when somebody gets a home equity line of credit, the bank doesn't take a bulldozer, scrape off the attached garage, and go cart it down to their parking lot and say, "Well, we're holding on to your garage until you pay back the loan." They
 
 
00:19:21
 
Cheri M.: Right.
Andrew Daniels: don't do that. They let the house remain an entirely whole asset, and it gets to appreciate the way houses do independently of the fact that there's a loan on it.
Cheri M.: Heat.
Andrew Daniels: The difference is instead of it being based on real estate, which is subject to economic conditions and all kinds of stuff that we can't control, it's based on how long they think you're going to live, which we know.
Cheri M.: Thanks.
Andrew Daniels: We know that we will all eventually die. We don't know when. And so there's a whole army of calculations that go on be behind that. But it does make it a little bit it does make it a very much different guaranteed um uh concept because we're all guaranteed to die, right?
Cheri M.: Bye.
Andrew Daniels: So we know it's going to happen. And so, um, without getting too much into the nitty-gritty, we know that the policy has some intrinsic, foundational, contractually guaranteed, and mathematical growth that has to happen whether there's a loan out on it or not, whether we do that strategy or not, whether you take money out or not, it absolutely has to grow by a certain amount every year.
 
 
00:20:28
 
Andrew Daniels: So, when I talk about giving you a financial floor and then make sure it increases, that increase is a function of how old you are now. and statistically when you're likely to die. And the shorter that the shorter that time frame is, the faster the growth that happens where it makes sense for the companies is that's capped.
Cheri M.: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: It's not unlimited. You can't just invest all your money infinitely into that. We're going to have to set the limits upfront, but the growth happens inside of those limits. And a lot of times it's not necessary to go all out. like we're going to have a really solid foundation with just a pretty reasonable amount upfront and then stacked on top of that when we take care of your debt. I expect that we'll be able to pay off the car and you guys can adjust your car payment at will rather than having $670 that has to come out every month.
Cheri M.: Actually,
Andrew Daniels: Maybe you guys give yourself a 12-month break when you go to retire, Melissa, and you say, "We're going to we're going to stop the car payment for 12 months, and then we're going to restart it at a third of what it was before just to keep things going in there." You
 
 
00:21:35
 
Andrew Daniels: don't have that control right now. If you were to retire today, you'd still have 670, and there'd be nothing you could do to change that payment.
Cheri M.: we refinanced this truck and got it down.
Andrew Daniels: Oh, good. Okay. Okay. So, I guess yeah, I couldn't I shouldn't say there's nothing you can do. There's nothing you can do without the permission of the bank.
Cheri M.: I know. Yeah, I know what you're saying. But we we we were able to get a lower interest rate.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, that is awesome. I love that. And that's the kind of that's the kind of stuff that I love to see you doing. Like I would have totally agreed with that if you'd asked me like yes, let's get a better rate. What is the new payment now?
Cheri M.: Yeah. Oh, Lord. the I want to say 538, but I'm not 100% sure.
Andrew Daniels: Awesome. Yeah. No, that's great. I mean, yeah, a 100 bucks.
 
 
00:22:20
 
Cheri M.: And this first payment is actually not due till November. So, what we're doing is the payment that was due for August, September, and October when we get the first statement, we're going to take those three payments at the old amount or at least at $600 and pay it
Andrew Daniels: Uhhuh.
Cheri M.: directly principal.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. So, you're see you're almost you're almost there. That kind of thinking of what you're doing, you are managing already your own capital storage. The only thing the life insurance does is give you the ability to make that capital storage hyperefficient because instead of building up in a savings account or a checking account that gives you crappy interest rate and they stop crediting interest once you have to make the payment, you should be running that through the policy and then when it's time for the payment, go ahead and take it back out. Then you get dividends on the $600 that you saved up for the rest of your life.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: So, you've got 90% of it already like set in your brain.
 
 
00:23:17
 
Andrew Daniels: You're already doing the actions. We just need the functional piece that allows you to keep that growing every time you run it through.
Cheri M.: Okay, it does.
Andrew Daniels: Hopefully that makes sense. Um, let me look. I took a note on the questions that we were talking about. Okay. Um, so liquidity. How do we plan for liquidity? Okay. So, the home path right now, the home path is an investment inside your IRA. You need to look at it as no different than having Apple stock or gold or fine art or any other investment that you could make. It's just wrapped in a certain tax classification.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: Here's the benefit to the home path. It's monthly income. It is at a it's at a contracted rate. And it's important for you to realize that 193 does not reduce the outstanding balance of 29,000 that they are obligated to, it is an interestonly payment to you.
Cheri M.: Gotcha.
Andrew Daniels: So in five years, not only will you have earned the the 193 every month, right, about it's going to be 11 it'll be about $11,600.
 
 
00:24:26
 
Cheri M.: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: You're also going to get back the 29,000 if you want to liquidate the note.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: So, we'll have a total in five years of $40,000.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: That extra 116 where it sits or where it lives while that five-year clock is ticking makes a difference or it can make a difference. You can let it sit in the cash account at the IRA and make I don't think they even give you interest there, right? Or you can take it out from your always taxable left pocket and you can put it into your life insurance, which is your never taxable right pocket.
Cheri M.: Right. Okay.
Andrew Daniels: And so all we're doing is we're taking the payment, you're still going to be up. If you look at your whole system and you look at the amount of cash that you have or the amount of value you have in your IRA at 29,000, no matter what we do with the 193, you will still be up 11,600 at the end of five years. That will never change.
 
 
00:25:35
 
Andrew Daniels: The difference is if you take it out of the IRA and put it into the life insurance, so the life insurance can then also grow with the 193 every month, then you get the 116 plus the growth of the life insurance policy.
Cheri M.: And how how do we know what that growth is? Or do we have any clue as to what that growth is?
Andrew Daniels: Uh we do, but I I would say it's about you can plan on about a good conservative amount is about four to 5%.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: when and here's here's the thing when we do this strategy the total annualized amount of earnings right and I would caution you um to not think about uh not think about your money growth in terms of a rate of return and this is really hard one for a lot of people because our whole society is all about what's the rate of return what's the rate of return right that Um, it's dangerous to do that because it
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: allows Wall Street to tell us that we're getting 5, 10, 15, 20, 80% returns in our retirement accounts, but almost everybody I work with comes to me at 65, 70 and they did all the right things with all the 30% gains in the S&P and somehow they don't have enough money at retirement.
 
 
00:26:56
 
Andrew Daniels: So clear evaluating things just on the basis of a rate of return doesn't give a clear enough whole picture for us to be able to retire confidently because lots of people are having this problem.
Cheri M.: All right.
Andrew Daniels: It's not just you, right? Um and I I think I've narrowed down the issue is the rate of return. We get so wrapped around that and that's a good that's a good rule of thumb. It's a good measure for getting up the mountain. But we're going to be really focused on helping you come down the mountain. Once you get to that point where we say, "Okay, go ahead and retire. We think we can make the numbers work." We need to make sure that that money, whatever, whatever nest egg we've built up between now and the time you retire. We need to make sure that whatever comes off of that will last for as long as both of you are alive, right? Whichever one lasts longest, that money, that income needs to last for as long as the whichever one of you lives longer.
 
 
00:27:49
 
Cheri M.: Gotcha.
Andrew Daniels: And that math is not based on rate of return.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: And so, um, but I will tell you this, right, to give you kind of a a good feeling about it. When you utilize a secured guaranteed rate on the outside of the policy and then you funnel money back into the policy, the actual return is somewhere around 15 15.9%. Annually when you combine all of it together.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: And so I feel really confident saying we're gonna double your return on your home path because you're and and even though the parts and pieces feel like they're kind of moving once we get it all set up practically
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: what will happen is you'll have a distribution from the IRA hit your bank account on let's say Home Path will will send the money on the 28th anywhere from the 28th to the 1st of the month.
Cheri M.: Correct.
Andrew Daniels: We a day or two to clear. So by the third we want directed IRA to deposit I want I don't want to do the whole amount.
 
 
00:28:52
 
Andrew Daniels: We need to leave a little bit in the IRA. But let's say 180, right?
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: IRA will deposit $180 to your checking account. Let's give it two days to clear. So by the 5th, you should have that 180 in your checking account. On let's say on the 6th, we tell Lafayette to draft your premium.
Cheri M.: Right.
Andrew Daniels: Your premium will consist of the 180 that we know is going to be there because Home Path pays that plus the additional amount that you want to be saving for retirement that you want to have access to. So maybe a good way to start that is, you know, a couple hundred, $200 on top of that. So if your total premium is 390 or 380, right? 200 of that comes from your pocket and 180 of that comes from the IRA via the whole deposit.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: What we'll do is we'll make that 200 optional when we write up the policy so that if something happens, if there's really something that we need to find uh more wiggle room or leeway in, you can cut that $200 off completely.
 
 
00:30:00
 
Andrew Daniels: Keep system in place with just the barebones from home and then we will resolve whatever financial issue comes up in the meantime. Typically, it doesn't financial situations don't last longer than a year, right? If there's something that happens, we'll have plenty of flexibility to make sure that the system can complete itself whether you live, die, or become disabled.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: And that's kind of why I do it this way. Over time, when you build up the values in the life insurance policy, we will start to chunk those out and take care of some of the debts that are creating a drag on your finances. when we get rid of those. Your job is to be a good banker, be a be a good business owner, right? Your business now is the business of money. And we need you to be profitable, right? You're not selling bananas. You're you're going to be a banker. So, when we trade out the credit card debt and we we run that through the policy, you make the payments back to the policy on whatever schedule we can figure out is comfortable for you.
 
 
00:31:05
 
Andrew Daniels: you're going to build back your capital and you're gonna then have that flexibility to reduce your cash flow uh requirement because now it's not the banker requiring you to make a $120 payment every month. Now, if there's a month that comes up and you guys want to go on vacation, you say, "Hey, let's pause our let's let's pause our all of our extra stuff to our policy for this month just so we have a little room." You can stop it and then two months later turn it all back on.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: really puts you in the position of the driver's seat. When you go to retire, we have a whole set of strategies that we will look at of how do we use this policy. I have people who take money from their policy in retirement and they don't have a plan to pay it back and that's totally acceptable.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: So, you don't need to worry necessarily about well, you know, am I going to be stuck paying premiums until I'm 85? Well, at and I I'll work on these numbers here, but uh at seven, excuse me, at 75, if your premium is 390 a month, so let's say, you know, $4,600 a year, at 75, you put in 4600 and your policy increases by 5,800.
 
 
00:32:16
 
Andrew Daniels: That's a 80% increase, right?
Cheri M.: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: It's a 26% increase. So, you get 120 126% of your premium back in usable liquid cash. You can't get that in the stock market. You won't be able to go spend $4,000 on Apple or Google and get a guaranteed 26% increase on that money at age 75. The difference is we're going to be capped at that 4600. We won't be able to
Cheri M.: What?
Andrew Daniels: do anymore. But that's okay. You don't need to. It doesn't It doesn't need to be huge. It needs to be steady, consistent, and predictable so that we can plan your life and then respond to the opportunities or the emergencies that come up.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: Does that does that how does that land with you?
Cheri M.: Um, that that makes sense.
Andrew Daniels: So, I want you to kind of think of your policy as the the um maybe like the platinum shoe box under your bed, right?
Cheri M.: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: You can always put money into it, but no one else can ever take money out of it.
 
 
00:33:28
 
Andrew Daniels: And when you take money out of it, um my my 11-year-old for Christmas got one of those little coin counters where it's like a jar, but it has like a little digital thing.
Cheri M.: Right.
Andrew Daniels: And so you put it in and it counts all the change for you, right?
Cheri M.: Right. Right.
Andrew Daniels: That's what this policy does. Every dollar you run through the little counter, the little odometer ticks up and then they calculate the dividends and interest based on the odometer reading and it can't go backwards. When you take money out, it doesn't deduct. You just take the money out and go use it. That's where we start to get these machines rolling that start to give you that foundation where all of a sudden you're going, "Wait a minute. How is there this much available? I didn't put this much in this year. I know you need that mechanism when you're retired. It needs to be providing more back than you put in. Which is the promise of Wall Street, but not the reality of Wall Street.
 
 
00:34:20
 
Andrew Daniels: They promise us that there's going to be more. But very rarely is that the case. There's more for the bankers. There's more for the stock brokers. There's more for the IRS.
Cheri M.: right now. Let me make sure I understand this.
Andrew Daniels: Yes. Go ahead.
Cheri M.: If we put I understand what you're saying from the directed IRA where instead of taking the full 193 we're looking at 180 and let's say I do $200 a month. Um sorry Mickey's talking to me.
Andrew Daniels: Oh no.
Cheri M.: Um okay if let's say I do that 200 that first month I don't need it. I do 200 the second month I don't need it. come that third month, if I need to go in and get that $600, are you saying that's available to take out?
Andrew Daniels: Yes. with a small caveat. There's about I would plan on about $560 available. They hold back a small amount to ensure that the policy doesn't lapse, right?
Cheri M.: Gotcha.
 
 
00:35:15
 
Andrew Daniels: And that is a purely a safety measure to make sure that you can't take it right up to the limit. What happens over probably a three to fouryear period, that gap of what they need to hold back versus what you put in closes and gets smaller and smaller to the point that eventually you when you put in 500, you have $510 available back, right? And that's component of time.
Cheri M.: and and what would be the process of getting how would it be available I guess is what I need to ask.
Andrew Daniels: you have a customer portal and when we when we set up the policy part of the draft form of what what checking account are they going to draw the money from we will check a box that says you are also allowed to to EFT money back into this account when you need money you don't have to call me you don't have to call Sherry you can get on your portal and say send me money right send me everything available send me $20 it doesn't matter they don't care and they will EFT it back to your
 
 
00:36:11
 
Cheri M.: I got you. I got you.
Andrew Daniels: So, practically, I find that it's pretty easy. Um, and if there's ever if there's ever a situation where you're like, gosh, I I need this money really quick. I've got something coming up that I got to, right? Call one of us and we will call the company and there are some things we can do to make it go faster. I've done it before where we can get like even like two or three days like we can shorten that time frame down. I don't think it should be a big deal. We're going to build up those values pretty quickly. So, I don't think you'll have an issue. There should be a good chunk in there that we build up very quickly. And it may be that the emergencies happen. It might not be something you have to take the whole amount. Um, right.
Cheri M.: Got you.
Andrew Daniels: And so there's every month you make a payment then it starts to replenish right away anyways.
 
 
00:37:10
 
Andrew Daniels: So, um, what's going to happen and what I hope that you will decide to do is take that other amount of money in your IRA that's still there and do a home path with it so that then you
Cheri M.: All right.
Andrew Daniels: can get more funding into your policy. It's likely that if and when you decide to do that, I'm not saying you have to. I understand we got to build the the credibility here, but it's likely that the way we're constructing this policy now, even that amount will be too much to put into the policy. So, you're going to be left with an extra pot of money that starts growing that we won't even have room to put it in anyways.
Cheri M.: You mean the rest of her um 401k or Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: So, whenever you're ready for that, you know, that's great. No pressure from us. I I like to do whatever somebody's ready for and comfortable with. It was good last year, it'll be good next year, right?
 
 
00:38:00
 
Cheri M.: Right.
Andrew Daniels: That's when you're ready to do that, that will also help fill up the policy. It might even be the case that year 200, you know, you're not even out of pocket for that 200 home path is going to pay for you to have your own capital base, right? Completely where whenever that happens, we will figure that out.
Cheri M.: Hey
Andrew Daniels: But it's based on how I have to make the policy. Now, it's likely that there won't be enough room to fit all the money anyways. So, you're going to have another spot that we start growing that'll be liquid for you to take from in the case of an emergency or an opportunity.
Cheri M.: Okay, I got you.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Perfect.
Cheri M.: I think it's making sense.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. So, um, when I make this, right, do you agree with using what we know is guaranteed income as the base? And then we know that you're completely off the hook for that for at least five years. you know that that's not coming out of your pocket.
 
 
00:39:03
 
Andrew Daniels: Everything you're going to do on top of that in your mind, you know, it's not a savings account, but it's just your secure storage, right? And yeah, it takes three or four days to access, but you can have that pot start growing and get those things under your control. as it grows and we do our six-month reviews, we'll look at your credit card debt and maybe we maybe over the next six months we get enough money that we can take a big, you know, take a big cut off the credit card, which would immediately, even the way credit cards work, even if you can't pay the whole thing off, if we cut the balance down by $1,000, it's going to lower your payment. So, we don't have to wait for years to start getting you cash flow, month-to-month cash flow relief and turning those dollars back into your own pocket. It might be in the next six months we're able to start cutting down some of that stuff as long as we organize it properly. And I'm going to insist that we leave a reasonable buffer so that the emergencies that do happen, we don't have to go back to the credit cards, right?
 
 
00:40:04
 
Cheri M.: I got you.
Andrew Daniels: I don't I when we want to get you out of that, but we want to go slow enough forward that you never have to go backwards again.
Cheri M.: Yes, I got you.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. So, okay. Um, did we close did we kind of close the circle on some of the practicality but also kind of the concepts of how we're integrating this piece into your system?
Cheri M.: Yes.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Um, do you have any questions, thoughts? How do you feel about things?
Cheri M.: Okay. Good.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, awesome. So, all the the really the only thing that's left is to choose a date that you want it to start and then complete that pre-authorized withdrawal. Um, if you want to, you know, if you think $200 is a good monthly peg, knowing that you can raise and lower that $200, it might be if you if you have to call us 45 days from now and say, "Sherry, that 200's kind of crazy. I don't want to I don't want to commit that every month out to the policy." Well,
 
 
00:41:00
 
Andrew Daniels: let's lower it. let's put it at 125 or what on top of the home path and then maybe and here's this is also kind of a particular about how this works. You can route some of the extra money just if you want to let it build up in your bank account and when it gets to $500, you can just send it into the policy up to the annual limit that we create. Right? So, we start with a middle monthly amount and you know that if there's extra that starts to build up, you can always send it in, but you're not obligated to.
Cheri M.: Yes.
Andrew Daniels: And so I want to make sure you understand there's a bare minimum, but there's also a maximum. And we're just going to kind of peg that 200 extra in the middle. So if your total's 390 one or 380, 180 of that covered. And you've got a range in there that we can kind of optimize over the next two or three months. See how it works.
 
 
00:41:46
 
Andrew Daniels: If it's going well, great. Let's leave it. If not, let's adjust.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: Um, does Eddie have any questions about this? I guess Okay.
Cheri M.: Not at all.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. No, that's fine. I just want to make sure if he's got questions that we kind of cover that too. Um I will uh Okay. So that's correct.
Cheri M.: So, how do we start the process with the home pass? Because that takes its own paperwork, right, to get that Okay,
Andrew Daniels: Um, probably the easiest thing for you to do is to log into your account with uh directed IRA. And on that here, let me just um I'm going to see if I can Yeah, I'm going to just show you where to go here.
Cheri M.: screenshot it.
Andrew Daniels: Uh uh oh. Oh, I went to the wrong one. Hold on a second. Sorry. My computer has been slow. You know what happened? Windows sent me a notification.
 
 
00:42:45
 
Andrew Daniels: and they're like, "Oh, Windows 10 is, you know, going away. No more support. You know, update, do this latest security update." I was like, "Well, okay, that's probably smart." So, I did it and guess what happened? My whole computer just slowed down to a crawl.
Cheri M.: Oh, wow.
Andrew Daniels: I'm like, "You guys, come on." Like, could it be any more obvious that you're trying to just get me to buy a new computer? Okay, so I've got into your dashboard here and I'm gonna share the screen.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: All right. Can you see that? I know it's probably pretty small.
Cheri M.: I don't see anything.
Andrew Daniels: Uh, you might have to switch the window. Uh, if my face is still on the here, let me just try and share it again real
Cheri M.: I don't know.
Andrew Daniels: quick. Maybe just reset it. Okay. How's that?
Cheri M.: It says you're sharing your screen, but I don't see anything. Hold on.
 
 
00:44:10
 
Cheri M.: Bless you.
Andrew Daniels: I'll try one more time.
Cheri M.: Thank you.
Andrew Daniels: Um, so well, I'll I'll just talk through it and then if you guys need to if you guys need to have questions, you can call me. Um there on your dashboard there should be an account forms section and under those forms you can do a distribution request. Um and you're going to do a uh for now it'll be an early distribution. I'm not worried about that though because $180 you've only got I mean you're so close to being 59 and a half. It's not going to be that much of a um what is it? June June 1 will be your 59 and a half date, right?
Cheri M.: All right.
Andrew Daniels: So that's only eight months at $180.
Cheri M.: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: That's $1,400. The taxes on that is going to be like a hundred a h 100red bucks for the next year. So if that's ownorous or if that causes a problem when you're filing taxes in 2026 after we've got a whole bunch of home path that's built up, after we've got your policy built up because you won't file that until 2026. If that's a problem, we can take it from the the cash value of the policy to cover those taxes and that those taxes will that the penalties and stuff will won't be a um an issue after
 
 
00:45:17
 
Cheri M.: Gotcha.
Andrew Daniels: Jul June of of 2026. Sorry, I guess I should say that filing that in 2027 for those.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: stuff.
Cheri M.: Right.
Andrew Daniels: So, we've got a long time to spread it out and it's it's a minim it's a minimal amount, but what it does for you by setting up the policy and supporting that base, you're going to get a lot more value out of that over the next two years than waiting eight months to set it up.
Cheri M.: Gotcha.
Andrew Daniels: Um, so yes, do the distribution and then um I would do this home path comes into the directed IRA around the end of the month. So between the 27th and the the 1st, give it a day or two to process. So do the directed IRA distribution to your bank account on the third. Then we should set up the Lafayette premium draft. Sometime after the 3rd or the fourth, so probably like the fifth or anytime after that, whatever works with your cash flow. as long as as long as that 180 has a chance to clear your bank account and funds are actually there.
 
 
00:46:26
 
Cheri M.: Gotcha.
Andrew Daniels: And so then you'll when um when you do the uh the pre-authorized withdrawal, which Sherry, you do have those forms, right?
Cheri M.: on mute.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. So when you guys do that, just kind of be cognizant of the time frame and give the banking system a couple of days to clear the distribution from directed IRA.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: Um, and for the pre-authorized withdrawal, you'll want to add the 200. So, your total premium will be 380. 200 of that will come out of your cash flow, but we're going to set up the policy so that as much of that 200, you know, 95% of that 200 is available as soon as they can process it and verify that the funds are cleared.
Cheri M.: Gotcha.
Andrew Daniels: Um, and that should be Oh, there is one more form that we need to do, Sherry. Um, we need to adjust uh we need to do the application page just because it's been a while and they the the applications are only good for six months.
Cheri M.: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: The underwriting rating is good for the whole year.
 
 
00:47:25
 
Andrew Daniels: So, we're not we're not in a problem there. Just before they issue the policy, they want a resigned and redated application page.
Cheri M.: Do I have the application page? Which one?
Andrew Daniels: Uh, yes, I'm going to prepare that, Sherry, and I'll send it to you.
Cheri M.: I have Okay.
Andrew Daniels: It should be on too.
Cheri M.: Cuz I know I have the agent report. I have the Okay.
Andrew Daniels: I'll um share I'll do an email as soon as we get off to make it really clear what what needs to be done.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: So you guys don't need to be searching around for forms and stuff. You already do enough of that at your job.
Cheri M.: This is true. That's what I'm doing right now.
Andrew Daniels: Um Melissa, do you have any other questions or is that does that kind of help clear it up about what part is going where?
Cheri M.: I think that helps clear it up.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. And we're just Yeah.
Cheri M.: That makes it that makes more sense for me now.
 
 
00:48:19
 
Cheri M.: And since you said I have a portal and all that, if I need something that it's available for me to get. I mean, I'm like you. My thoughts are that I I'm hoping that I don't need it. But, you know, I'm kind of po.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Cheri M.: So, Right.
Andrew Daniels: No, we we like to we like to hope for the best, but plan for the worst. That's that's everything that goes into what I'm doing here is I'm going I hope everything works out and that um you know, you get pay raises and all kinds of extra money that you didn't expect. But if that doesn't happen, if social security goes away, if they if social security, you know, doesn't do their COLA increases the way they're supposed to, if right, whatever eventuality happens, we want you to be in the best possible position to stay flexible and liquid where you don't need those credit cards anymore.
Cheri M.: Awesome. Correct.
Andrew Daniels: So, I'm going to plan for that worst case scenario, and everything else that happens on top of that is just gravy.
 
 
00:49:18
 
Andrew Daniels: I've never had somebody not be able to figure out what to do with the extra.
Cheri M.: Well, me neither. I like Brady.
Andrew Daniels: There you go. Okay. Um, any other questions? Anything else I can help answer?
Cheri M.: No, I think I'm good right now.
Andrew Daniels: I'm sure you're going to have more. And I just want to say this always like don't feel bad like if if tomorrow or a week from now you're like, "Wait a minute. I cannot for the life of me remember why the home path is going into the life insurance." Don't be afraid to ask. It's pretty normal. What we're doing is kind of it is complex, but once it's set, it's not going to change much, right? And so over time, you're going to see the same kinds of maneuvers, the same kinds of transfers happen, and it will become more familiar. And I think it takes about two years, but you're you are so sharp and you put a lot of thought into this. Even though it's hard and complex to think about, I can tell that you've got a brain for it, right? And so as we make these conversations and stuff is going to come up, probably within about two years, you're going to start coming to us and saying, "Hey, this thing happened. I already took the money from the policy. Here's how I'm going to make it work." And it's going to be exactly the way that we would have done all the math and figured out anyways. Like we will help you learn how to do it correctly. And I think you'll really enjoy the process once it becomes set and familiar.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: So, okay, I'm going to type up an email with the exact forms that we need.

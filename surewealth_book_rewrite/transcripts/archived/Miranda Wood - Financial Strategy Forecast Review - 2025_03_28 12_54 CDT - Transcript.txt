Andrew Daniels: No worries. But I think it's so great that you have that option. And the way the tax forms work is you list all of your income and then they get to that adjusted gross. You get your standard deduction or your itemized and then they start charging taxes. Right? So the best place that you can do this is…
Miranda Wood: Okay. Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: if you show a loss on a schedule C. And there's no rule that says you have to be a good business owner. There's no rule that says you have to make good business decisions. You can have loss years. You can have plus. There's no limit. like that they don't do that. All you have to do is certify that you materially participate. And clearly he does, so there's an opportunity there and I'll show you where I noticed this when the way it's set up, which I don't expect you would have known this, but if we show him as making income from W2, look at what happens on our tax tab.
Miranda Wood: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: When we look at your projected taxes, we have Yeah,…
Miranda Wood: Yeah, I and…
Miranda Wood: I was like, dang, those are some big numbers. yeah.
Andrew Daniels: we have a total tax of 25 thou almost 20 $2,300. That's a lot, right? I mean,…
Miranda Wood: And I was like, dang, is it really that much? I was like,…
Andrew Daniels: and what they're And that's almost two grand.
Miranda Wood: you added up at the end of the year, I guess it is, but I'm like, dang.
Andrew Daniels: Two grand a month that you guys are potentially going to be charged. and some of that is for the FICA tax right now. that we're not going to be able to do anything about that on your part, But I have some ways to make sense. we can do something about that FICA tax. In fact, we're going to be very motivated to try and do something about that FICA tax because it is a 15.4%
Andrew Daniels: 4% additional charge way at the bottom of the tax return, which did you show a loss in your business or a profit for the business schedule C last year?
Miranda Wood: …
Miranda Wood: it would technically be a profit because he said he showed that he made 11 or 12,000 and then we deducted 2500. But because we…
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Miranda Wood: because I worked in Missouri and then North Dakota, adding them together, I significantly overpaid in Missouri on my taxes, so they just took out what we would have owed in North Dakota and said, "You don't owe anything." So,…
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Okay.
Miranda Wood: it was very confusing. My grandma did our taxes, and we were like, "We don't owe anything." She goes, "You don't owe anything." I said, "Are you sure? Are they going to come back at me?" she's like, "No." She goes, "You overpaid a lot in Missouri." …
Miranda Wood: and I was like, "Okay." So she's like, "It just showed that they took it out of that." And I was like, "Taxes are confusing." So
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, there.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, There's a lot to it, but I'll help you simplify it. The rule is at the very first line, if you go to the tax code, the regulations, At the very top, they say everything that you make, any value received as a US citizen,…
Andrew Daniels: not even cash, any value received anywhere worldwide for any reason is taxable. And then the next 10,000 pages are all the ways that it's not taxable. So, right.
Miranda Wood: My goodness.
Miranda Wood: Here's the ways to not pay taxes.
Andrew Daniels: So, really, it's like I look at those regulations. Those are the guide book. What do you need to do in your life to make sure that something that income that you bring in is not taxable? And I think you guys have really with him having the schedule C as a 1099, there's a lot of opportunity there to take this down.
Andrew Daniels: And I don't know if you saw this, but this is kind of like just over the years how much tax you guys are going to pay at your current income.
Miranda Wood: Yeah, I saw that and…
Miranda Wood: I was like, "Holy bears." I was like,…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah.
Miranda Wood: "Why are we in the millions? "What the heck is going on?" I was like,…
Andrew Daniels: And…
Miranda Wood: I don't like that.
Andrew Daniels: usually what happens is this farther out you go, the less realistic it is. Partially because somewhere in here they're going to change the tax code. They're going to adjust it. they're going to make it'll get too painful for the voters and they'll rate it down somewhat. But in general, it still does climb even if it doesn't take quite that much. the other problem that's happening here with this is that we've applied a 10% increase to Earl. So, after 30 years of that, right, it's going to look really crazy. So, there's some assumptions
Miranda Wood: Yeah, it's hard cuz right if he even did the math and…
Andrew Daniels: Right. Yeah.
Miranda Wood: he's like, "Okay, so I'm making 2,200 every two weeks or whatever." Yeah. And so he's like, " clients that I have, if I was actually getting paid what I should be getting paid," he's like, "I should be up to 10,000 a month." And he's like, "So I'm like, okay." I was like, "I guess I'll put that in there." I was like, "But it's going to be like I was like, and he has basically unlimited however many he gets paid like he takes on more clients. I mean that's Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: However many hours are in the week.
Miranda Wood: I mean it's a huge mental load. So he's like I'm only going to cap out at 25.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah.
00:05:00
Miranda Wood: He's like, "But even at 25, I'm making double here what I'm currently making." So, I'm like, "I don't really know how to put that in. I'm gonna put 10 thou 10%." because it's going to be higher, but I knew we were going to update things.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah.
Miranda Wood: But I knew it was going to raise a flag in your head being like, "Okay, what does she think?" Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Far down the road 10% increases every year looks pretty good. Yeah. …
Miranda Wood: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, I'm like, "Okay, it's going to increase tfold in the next, six months."  and then who knows after that. yeah.
Andrew Daniels: And really what you guys that discussion you're having is a very different discussion than one that we might have with a W2 employee. at John Deere, we're not going to talk about 10% raises every year. There's not really a method for you as an employee to double your income in any kind of reasonable period of time.
Andrew Daniels: But when you own a business, you absolutely can. And right, as he gets busier, it I don't know,…
Andrew Daniels: it might be the kind of thing that takes off and all of a sudden his business can cover your salary and that's just kind of how that works. I think business ownership is great. so here's what I'm going to do. I'll go in here and I'll adjust some of the tax type that's on here. because I can set it up as if it's a self-employed and I'll set them up as self-employed income.
Miranda Wood: I didn't know how to do that. So, okay.
Miranda Wood: 
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah.
Miranda Wood: Perfect. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: So then it will give us a more accurate reflection of that.
Andrew Daniels: The other thing is when I do this kind of planning we need to work on income not if come right so…
Miranda Wood: Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: what I'll do is I'll construct our base scenario on exactly how it is today right and…
Miranda Wood: Yeah. Perfect.
Andrew Daniels: then as we go through updates and we start to say what kinds of things are we going to do and…
Andrew Daniels: maybe we do employ some strategies that I have right now and you guys say okay we want to do something to get our foundation set up It's totally fine to start very small and very reasonably and conservatively let's start with the bare minimum of what we think will give you a good foundation and still give you some measurable gains and then as you grow we can add to that. We can always expand the system. Having it is better than not having it.
Miranda Wood: Mhm.
Miranda Wood: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Having one that's too big that you like bit off more than you can chew, not ideal, right?
Andrew Daniels: But I work with a lot of business owners and one of the things that you guys have in your back pocket is that you have the desire, you have the motivation, you already have the licenses and everything set up, you already have some tax experience. So, you're 60% of the way there to really running a successful business that can actually support your lifestyle. And I think with some of these other pieces in place, one of the things that I hope it will do is help smooth out some of the feast or famine that happens in the early stages of starting a business because that always is the case.
Miranda Wood: Yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: So yeah.
Miranda Wood: I mean, that was kind of the last six months. So, we seem to be like, he's building up rapport. Hes keeping He's getting more clients. So, that seems to be not as you have one client a week.
Miranda Wood: You can't survive on $50 a week.
Andrew Daniels: No way.
Miranda Wood: It just doesn't work. especially when I didn't have any income yet. So I was like this is whoa like this is I never want to be in that position again.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Right. Yes.
Miranda Wood: So yeah it see we were very up and…
Andrew Daniels: Yep. I know.
Miranda Wood: down and down and…
Andrew Daniels: That's how it happens in business. It's like, We got it. No, we don't.
Miranda Wood: 
Miranda Wood: I mean his is different. he could have marketed himself but it's so for some people marketing yourself as a counselor comes off weird it's a weird industry to do that to instead of compared to real estate …
Andrew Daniels: Right. Yeah.
Miranda Wood: where you have to market yourself this one some people would be like he has too big of an ego I can't handle that so it's very like he's just like okay we're just gonna keep praying that people come And Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: and the right people will that's the other thing too right so okay so the other thing I notice is we don't have any social security benefits in here right so …
Miranda Wood: Yeah. I didn't know what is that like
Andrew Daniels: what I would encourage you to do is I would encourage you and I'm thinking given the current environment you guys probably need to do this as quickly and as soon as you can this is the highest priority you have to go to the social security administration website.
Miranda Wood: I've seen this on Tik Tok to actually download what you've put in. Is that what you're doing?
Andrew Daniels: Not just that,…
Miranda Wood: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: but you need to claim your accounts, on both the IRS website and you can go here to the signin and this login.gov or id.mme I would use the login.gov. it's across all of the federal government services.
00:10:00
Andrew Daniels: But then also go to the IRS website and make sure that each of you individually claims your login. And where is that The reason there on the front page. Sign into your account. So the reason for this is a couple of fold. first off, I'm getting some information and some sensation that politically whatever's going on with Doge and all of that. The move that they're probably going to make is they're going to say…
Miranda Wood: Thank you. True.
Andrew Daniels: if you're not already registered, then we're going to cut it off and you're not going to be able to be in the system. They've already gone on and mucked around with the records that are currently there.
Andrew Daniels: So I think it can't hurt for on multiple levels. Get your account claimed first because if you claim it then fraudsters can't, right? But also now you've claimed your account, you've attached it to your identity with whatever system they've got now. At least there's some kind of claim that says I am this person who is attached to this record. I went and did all the verification. Right? That's what they're going to be probably attacking first is they're going to say, we have all these records. We don't know who these people are. We're going to clear out all the old records and you have a certain deadline to claim by the time all of that messaging comes out. It will be too late. There won't be server capacity. It'll be crashing.
Miranda Wood: You're good.
Andrew Daniels: No one works at the offices anymore. So, right, you guys should go on and claim both of those login." here's the other benefit, right?
Andrew Daniels: I'm not trying to fearonger anything. I'm just watching what's happening and I'm like, if I was an evil genius that was intent on dismantling the government, that's kind of how I would do it. I don't want to do that, though. So, the real benefit for what we're talking about, though, is that you can pull your social security statement and you can see what your projected earnings will be at your full retirement age. We can plug that in here as a Now, this is the normal social security retirement. your retirement age is probably 67, right? Doesn't mean that you can't take it sooner and…
Miranda Wood: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: we will optimize on that, right? If it's still around by then, we'll figure out what to do.
Andrew Daniels: I always add this in because it's an important part of the conversation, but we always make a plan that if it's not there that things go off the way we need them to either way, right? And you guys are young enough. I don't like this is going to be like when you're in your 60s either way. you're not even going to consider taking social security. It's not going to be a factor until you're at least 62. but we want to have it in there because we want to know what things look like with it.  We want to make sure that whatever earnings you guys have put forth are actually accurate with what's been reported. and when you get into your IRS portal, if you haven't done that already, you should request what's called an taxpayer PIN number. That is a five-digit code that's generated every year, fresh. It's a brand new code for each of you, and you'll have to submit it with your tax return.
Andrew Daniels: The amount of tax return fraud has been at all-time high for the last couple of years pretty much since COVID it started to come down when they did that $80 billion package to hire IRS agents and now those have all been fired and…
Miranda Wood: Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: so I've had clients who have had tax return fraud and it is impossible with a properly functioning IRS workforce to get it fixed. if something happens, it will be impossible to prove that are who you say you are to anyone because there will be no one to listen. So, the PIN number that you can get directly through the IRS website is the best way to make sure that no one can file your taxes for you that you have to have that PIN number when you file. Those two things are probably pretty important since a lot of our lives rest with those two organizations.
Andrew Daniels: So we want to get those. we can do what they have here is they have a quick count. where did that go? So, this is usually what I do. let's see. 11 197 when we're looking at and you make 83,000 now. So, they just do this track back and it's a quick calculator. So, if you were born in 97 and you're making $83,000 now, your full retirement age is 67.
Andrew Daniels: Here, let me zoom in on and that means you should have $2,924 a month at age 67.
Miranda Wood: Get okay.
Andrew Daniels: So, we'll use that as kind of the benchmark.
00:15:00
Andrew Daniels: 2924. We'll use that as the benchmark for now. Once you get real numbers, we can adjust and put that in. 60. There we go.
Andrew Daniels: And Earl's probably got a similar calculation, too. 90.
Miranda Wood: So, he was born in 92.
Miranda Wood: 92. Yeah,…
Andrew Daniels: 92. I must have put that in there. I didn't know your birthday, so I just put something.
Miranda Wood: I think you just threw in numbers.
Andrew Daniels: I did.
Miranda Wood: It's okay.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, 1992. it forces me to put birth dates in, but I don't always get it. So, all right,…
Miranda Wood: It's okay.
Andrew Daniels: there we go.
Andrew Daniels: 92. …
Miranda Wood: Yeah, I can go in and…
Miranda Wood: update those to our actual birthdays.
Andrew Daniels: yeah, because a lot of it, too. so let's see. $4,400 a month. Is that pretty normal for what he's made over his career? Okay.
Miranda Wood: No, this is actually the most he's ever made. I mean, he was kind of all over the place.
Miranda Wood: he worked in a factory and then he dropped out and went to work at camp and then went back to school when he met me and then he's been in school,…
Andrew Daniels: If he worked in a factory,…
Andrew Daniels: did he have any pensions or anything? How long did he work?
Miranda Wood: I don't know. That was 10 years ago,…
Andrew Daniels: Do you know how long he worked for him?
Miranda Wood: a couple years.
Andrew Daniels: he might actually have qualified for their pension plan…
Andrew Daniels: which be I mean it might not be a lot but it's something right and the preference that I always Yeah.
Miranda Wood: I don't even know…
Miranda Wood: if he knows that. Okay.
Andrew Daniels: It's something to definitely research. call up the benefits administrator for the company and just say hey did you guys have a pension when I worked there? Was I qualified? They can tell you and then we can track that and it's going to just sit there in their program until he's ready to file.
Andrew Daniels: But that won't be for 20 years at least 30 years.
Andrew Daniels: So the other thing too is a lot of times if you leave the company and you don't want to leave it in the pension they'll give you a cash out option. So okay yeah that's okay.
Miranda Wood: He might have done that.
Miranda Wood: Knowing where he was in his state of life, I'm pretty sure he probably just took the cash out because he made himself get fired because he hated it so much. So, he might have just been like,…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah.
Miranda Wood: 
Miranda Wood: "Just give me the money. I'm done." …
Andrew Daniels: Right. Yeah.
Miranda Wood: we'll ask him when he gets here, but that sounds like,…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Miranda Wood: 20-year-old Earl, so
Andrew Daniels: Yep. Yeah. I mean, lots of 20-year-olds probably do that. So, Couple of things I wanted to make sure of. I love this expense plan, and this is great. did you see the software will automatically apply an inflation rate to each of those?
Andrew Daniels: So we can get inflationadjusted expenses over the years, And so we're going to know as things get more expensive, our question that we want to answer is, can we afford things getting more expensive? And so you can see this is the pre-retirement …
Miranda Wood: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: where we're looking at that. And this is probably going to be the most relevant for you because I mean you guys are going to make decisions like do we buy a house this year or next year? and that's going to really impact the next 20 or 30 years. So, we want to see these numbers here. As it stands now, we've got some good net monthly cash flow, even including your taxable income and that $3,000 a month worth of taxes and all that. So, right now, it's looking pretty good. And with the increases, I did back off the 10% increase. I did that to 1%. We'll update those as it goes.
Andrew Daniels: But even so, you've got some pretty good cash flow. what this doesn't account for is it doesn't account for anything, large expenditures. the budget, I love this detailed budget, super helpful, right? …
Miranda Wood: I did notice it had Medicare in there.
Miranda Wood: But I couldn't delete them.
Andrew Daniels: yes. And that Yes.
Miranda Wood: The start dates. I was like, why is he accounting for those? I was like, what? Those aren't in there.
Andrew Daniels: And…
Andrew Daniels: they force us to do that because they don't want us to forget that that is a cost that you're going to have to, be charged in retirement.
Miranda Wood: That's completely I literally just now saw the star dates and…
Miranda Wood: I was like,…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah.
Miranda Wood: why is it not letting me?
Andrew Daniels: I'm not paying for this yet. but no,…
Miranda Wood: Yeah. Yeah,…
Andrew Daniels: that's the kind of thing we just want to plan for that. And so, it's going to start that, way out in the future.
Andrew Daniels: But where that kind of comes due is when we look at the retirement tab and we say, "Okay, what do you guys have after retirement?" Right? And we're going to fix this because some of this is not quite correct. So, we need to Okay.
Miranda Wood: under the expenses I had put in. If you go all the way down to miscellaneous. I had the retirement in there because I assumed they were going to autoenroll me. and…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yes.
Miranda Wood: then savings are in there So I know I had some things in there that are probably going to get moved to other places. but I was just like this is…
Andrew Daniels: Yep. Absolutely.
00:20:00
Miranda Wood: 
Miranda Wood: what I know it is right now. So, those are business expenses.
Andrew Daniels: I love that you have some line item aortionments for savings. I see that some of these are these supervisor sessions and EMDR training. I'm assuming those are business expenses for Yeah,…
Miranda Wood: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: I love that. Yes.
Andrew Daniels: I mean, they still have to come out of your pocket. No, it's very good to include those in here. one of the things that I do notice quite immediately is, okay, health insurance 247. That feels low. Does that cover all of you?
Miranda Wood: No, It's accurate. I am not even kidding. Yeah, it's insane.
Andrew Daniels: What? Dang.
Miranda Wood: I Yeah,…
Andrew Daniels: All from John Deere.
Miranda Wood: I questioned them and…
Andrew Daniels: I love that.
Miranda Wood: I was like, "Are you sure?" I was…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Right.
Miranda Wood: "This is not a week." Because I paid $600, $700 a month last time.
Andrew Daniels: Wow.
Miranda Wood: I was like, "This is not per week." And they're like, "No, it's 123 a pay period." And I was "For dental and vision and medical, fully covered,…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. All right.
Miranda Wood: you pay 90%, I cover 10." And they're like, "Yeah." And I was like,…
Andrew Daniels: Game on.
Miranda Wood: I was like, "You got it." I said, "I love it." I said,…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Eight or…
Miranda Wood: "I paid 247." it was literally I think I worked at a hospital and I think we were paying $6,700 a month and…
Andrew Daniels: $900 a month easily.
Miranda Wood: that was cheap.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, I believe it. Yeah.
Miranda Wood: And I was Yeah. So, no.
Andrew Daniels: I've worked I've got,…
Miranda Wood: No, that's accurate.
Andrew Daniels: I've got nurses and…
Miranda Wood: And that's amazing.
Andrew Daniels: doctors that have similar,…
Miranda Wood: So, Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: they work at a health care facility and their health insurance is through the roof. So, I always like to double check on that because that can be the most surprising expense,…
Miranda Wood: No, I know.
Andrew Daniels: a lot of times.
Miranda Wood: No, I had just confirmed it and I went back in because I had it a lot higher. we had it at 600 and…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, that is really good.
Miranda Wood: then I went back in there and I was like, "No, that's accurate." I was like, "It's 247." I was like, "Dang, that's so nice.
Andrew Daniels: Food at 490 with some dining out.
Andrew Daniels: Is that pretty accurate?
Miranda Wood: Yeah. …
Miranda Wood: we've been doing pretty good at that. Yeah, you're fine.
Andrew Daniels: That's good.
Miranda Wood: I'm just fine with Andy. he's come home now.
Andrew Daniels: Welcome home, So, here's some other opportunities that I see. So, we've got the auto loans at 470. Is that just for a single car or…
Miranda Wood: I just see car.
Andrew Daniels: multiple? Okay.
Miranda Wood: Just one car. Yeah. …
Andrew Daniels: And whose car is that? Yours or Earl's? Okay.
Miranda Wood: it's technically an Earl's name.
Andrew Daniels: And how long have you had it? And when do we think that car is going to have to or…
Miranda Wood: We bought it.
Andrew Daniels: what's the balance?
Miranda Wood: Was it 2021? He's not listening to me. Yes, I'm talking to 2021. It was a six-year loan.
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Miranda Wood: So 2027.
Andrew Daniels: and you've been putting extra on it.
Miranda Wood: Yeah. I am going to put extra on it.
Andrew Daniels: What's the balance remaining?
Miranda Wood: We've only been paying the minimum.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Yep.
Miranda Wood: So, our goal is to get rid of it. let me pull up my exel spreadsheet because I put that on here.
Andrew Daniels: Yep. No worries.
Miranda Wood: I think there's 14,000 left on it.
Andrew Daniels: Perfect. And that technically is going to end 2027.
Andrew Daniels: and you would like to pay it off early just based on what I'm seeing here. Okay. Okay.
Miranda Wood: Yeah. Yeah.
Miranda Wood: Cuz I have it'll be November or December of 2027. So, it's the end of the year with…
Andrew Daniels: There we go. and you're wanting to do where is it? Carlo how did you come up with $210? Is that just budget?
Miranda Wood: what I had left over in the budget.
Miranda Wood: It's just playable money that I have left over. So,
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: So one of the things that I think we can do that's totally doable if you have that extra already put towards there. let me see if There's a way that we can kind of straddle both worlds.
Andrew Daniels: If you have to have a car loan outstanding, the best case scenario is that you have the quote loan, but you own the loan and you continue to make payments to the loan, but it only goes back to you instead of out to anyone else, money from your left pocket to your right pocket.
Miranda Wood: Yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: I don't know yet if it's possible to do that all in one fell swoop.
Miranda Wood: Yeah. The other loan that we want to get rid of is that 360 payout.
Andrew Daniels: Although, I was Yes,…
Miranda Wood: It's like Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: I was going to ask about that.
Miranda Wood: So that one's $5,000. So he had to pay to get out of his other job.
Andrew Daniels: Uh.
Miranda Wood: It was a buyout. So it's 5,000. So we're trying to get rid of that one soon as possible. so that's why that's at we have a whole year to pay it off. she doesn't care…
Andrew Daniels: Even though you moved to another state.
Miranda Wood: 
Miranda Wood: how much we pay. but we have to pay it within a year. So, this is in the state. So, he got this one and he only made what $900 with her and it was technically a $10,000 buyout and we negotiated it down to five cuz we're like girlfriend we've not even made $1,000 with you. you've made three times what he made because you're billing insurance 300 and paying him $40. So, you're making a ton off of him.
00:25:00
Miranda Wood: And so we negotiated back down to five. And she's like, "Yeah, that's fine." And we're like, "Okay, we can't pay for a couple months." She goes,…
Miranda Wood: "That's fine. Just as long as it's paid within a year." We're like, "Okay." and then I got my job and we're like, "We just want it done. we just would rather just pay it out." So, that one is that one doesn't have any interest on it. but we're still wanting it to the year will be next February,…
Andrew Daniels: When is it due?
Andrew Daniels: When's your god.
Miranda Wood: 
Miranda Wood: Yeah. Yeah, it will be in April.
Andrew Daniels: My goodness. are you currently doing the 640 a month on that or is that to start? Uhhuh.
Miranda Wood: So, it'll be starting this next month. Yeah. we haven't told her anything as long as she receives something a month. She doesn't care how much it is, if that makes sense. So, We committed to 420 a month because we said we would pay it over a year.
Miranda Wood: So that's why we got the 420. And then the six was the playable,…
Andrew Daniels: I see.
Miranda Wood: the extra I had that I threw at it.
Andrew Daniels: Got it. That makes sense. so just for purposes of that's just hanging out there. That's psychological why do we have to deal with this lady who's obviously not gonna like Yes, we just cut that out as quickly as possible.
Andrew Daniels: That makes more sense about what that is. And then what is Okay, student ans. Give me the breakdown on the student Total balances are fine. I know when we talked you said the student loans are kind of ridiculous. Have gotten to a ridiculous point. Okay.
Miranda Wood: They're changing…
Miranda Wood: because of what Trump's doing. Yeah, they're changing because of all they're getting rid of the Department of Education. So, We really don't know what's going to happen with our loans. I have 35,000. Earl has 115,000. So, …
Miranda Wood: we own a we literally could buy a house with our student loans. so,…
Andrew Daniels: Are those okay?
Andrew Daniels: Are they all federally subsidized?
Miranda Wood: but one of mine, all but the one that says Truman loan, he has a $1,000 loan. right.
Miranda Wood: It's 900 or something left. The one that's $40 a month. that's all he's has to pay, but there's only less than $1,000 left on that one.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, I see.
Miranda Wood: That's the only one that's not a federal subsidized loan. All of mine are and…
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Miranda Wood: then the rest of his are That would Yeah,…
Andrew Daniels: Okay, that one. just off the top of my head, although you guys do have enough room.
Andrew Daniels: If we rearrange things smartly, we could get that attack plan could take less than five years. I've done a whole lot more with a whole lot less.
Miranda Wood: that would be amazing…
Andrew Daniels: So yeah,…
Miranda Wood: because I think right now I mean the fastest you can do is 10 years and it's thousands of dollars a month just to get it evened down.
Andrew Daniels: yeah, right.
Miranda Wood: And…
Miranda Wood: I think that I just had thrown in money at that's why it's a hundred and 200 cuz we don't know. They're not due yet. I might have never been due since I graduated in 2018 or…
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Yeah.
Miranda Wood: 2019 because I would had that six-month grace period. COVID happened and they've been in deferment ever since they've never come due. So, I have yet to have a student loan payment…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Miranda Wood: because they've never been I've thrown some money at it, but the interest has just I have looked at it currently.
Andrew Daniels: when you pulled the statements is the balance currently 35?
Miranda Wood: 
Miranda Wood: That's why I got the 35.
Andrew Daniels: How do you see interest?
Miranda Wood: So, they're all on advantage or whatever. and so they're currently still saying yes.
Andrew Daniels: Does that 35 include acred interest?
Miranda Wood: Yes. No,…
Andrew Daniels: Okay. I just want to make sure that it's not like 55 with they come in later and…
Miranda Wood: no, no. those are No,…
Andrew Daniels: by the way you got interest this whole time.
Miranda Wood: Those are with interest. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Okay. So that Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: And at least that gives us our target number to kind of go for it.
Andrew Daniels: Got All right. Put these notes in here. let's see. What is the car loan to? It looks like grandma.
Miranda Wood: Yeah, just we owe grandma like $9,000.
Miranda Wood: She bought our car and so we're just paying her back.
Andrew Daniels: Is this a different car than the one that we have? Okay.
Miranda Wood: It's a car that we had and sold before the transmission went out. Yeah. So,…
00:30:00
Miranda Wood: but we used it as a trade in to get a different car that we ended up selling too. So, it's three cars behind. we still grandma for the initial amount.
Andrew Daniels: But we still owe grandma for the payments.
Miranda Wood: Yes. Yep.
Andrew Daniels: Makes sense. And I like the concept of the family bank. it can and it should work. There's no reason why every generation has to start from square zero every time. a lot of times though it's just informalized and it's not as efficient as it could or should be. and so, let's see. You said there's $9,000 left on that. All right. and you guys are giving her $200 a month.
Miranda Wood: Yeah. …
Andrew Daniels: Since it's grandma, we could probably take care of that one very last and just keep up those $200 a month.
Miranda Wood: So, I mean, it shows that we'll pay it off in 45 months.
Miranda Wood: So, 3.75 years is what I have down. and I think we got that car two years ago and we haven't made a single payment yet. And she's like, "It's fine." So, yeah,…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yep.
Andrew Daniels: So, that's okay.
Miranda Wood: she's like, "Other people owe me more money. I'm not worried about it." And I was like, "Okay." She is.
Andrew Daniels: Your grandma sounds awesome. So, let's see. That's three. Yep. 45 months.
Miranda Wood: We know we'll have
Andrew Daniels: 36. so 25. So, if we start that this year, 28, that would be 29 and about threequarters of the year. So, we're in March, we'll say there. All right. and I like to put end dates on things that make sense.
Andrew Daniels: Select the car loan. that one we should end date that in 2027 and make sure that that doesn't track through to your expense plan all the way through. that's going to be done.
Andrew Daniels: And then we're going to see how the numbers look once we get done kind of updating this. I don't know about the student loan end date. I guess we're just going to have to wait and see what they say. no.
Miranda Wood: 64 years.
Miranda Wood: Yeah. it's just I mean if we paid it at this rate like theund and 150 Earl will pay his off in 76 and I will pay mine off in 14.6 years which It's just comical because it's like we're never going to keep up with the interest on it, but just we were going to start paying on them now that there's still kind of a and…
Miranda Wood: I think I finally got saying you owe $40 a month I think is what starting in April and Earl's doesn't have so anything that we put towards it will be straight principal. So, …
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Yeah.
Miranda Wood: we were just going to start just try and chip away at it one wood chip at a time. So, the emergency savings I just want to get to 15,000.
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Miranda Wood: So, that will take a year.
Andrew Daniels: It'll take a year without me.
Miranda Wood: Yeah. Yeah. By myself.
Andrew Daniels: It'll be quicker if I help you.
Miranda Wood: Yes. True.
Andrew Daniels: I'm gonna move that you were right.
Miranda Wood: 
Miranda Wood: We want our money to work for us. So probably
Andrew Daniels: I am going to move that John Deere over to another spot.
Andrew Daniels: just so that the system can track it properly. it's a 401k, right? let's see. Okay, so we'll take a look at this. And I think this helps. I've got some good ideas already based on…
Andrew Daniels: what you guys have seen and do they match dollar for dollar on
Miranda Wood: So that's…
Miranda Wood: where they match the first p 2% they match 300% and then they matched 1% up to the other amount. Hold on. I just had my offer letter pulled up. It's very confusing. They match 300% I think of the first one or…
Miranda Wood: 2% that I do and then it's match one for one up to that 6%. That's why they just kind of autoenroll you at 6%.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. …
Andrew Daniels: I'm gonna do some math and figure out what the actual effective first contribution is.
Miranda Wood: That means Yeah. Yeah. It's a lot of lingo. I'm like Okay. I mean it sounds good.
Andrew Daniels: I mean, that makes sense to me. I'm familiar with them doing all kinds of usually it's 50% of the first 3% and…
Andrew Daniels: whatever. …
Miranda Wood: work computer.
Miranda Wood: I was like, why am I not finding it? That's my word computer. So, that makes sense.
Andrew Daniels: So, with your new cash flow, with your situation where you guys are now, and it looks like just from what I can tell, and I'm going to have to spend some time on this, and I will look through and I'll kind of play around, you guys are coming off of kind of a famine period, right?
00:35:00
Andrew Daniels: So, there's going to be some inertia of you get your check and…
Andrew Daniels: we have to kind of get a couple of paychecks in. The 4,400 a month helps with Earl's job. We need to let that kind of it'll be a couple of cycles for that to kind of start to feel normal again.
Miranda Wood: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: I just want to make sure I think we've got all of the expenses in here. You did a good job getting this all in up front and I don't see anything else I'm going to make that a goal.
Andrew Daniels: savings to build a house and that's on top of the emergency savings. Okay. What do you guys in your mind…
Miranda Wood: Yeah, with the different savings.
Miranda Wood: Yeah, I don't know.
Andrew Daniels: what do you need to have that built up too to start building a house?
Miranda Wood: We were just going to start it's either savings to build or buy a home. So, it's just more like towards a home in general.
Andrew Daniels: Right. …
Miranda Wood: I mean, ideally, so 250 our max is…
Andrew Daniels: what kind of price point are you looking at for building or buying? Is it 200,000?
Andrew Daniels: Is it 400,000?
Miranda Wood: what we're wanting to do. I feel like 250 buying is going to go a lot less than 250 building because we plan on building a smaller frame.
Andrew Daniels: Right. Yeah.
Miranda Wood: We're more concerned about land than we are the house and inside space. so I mean we've looked at some plans and some cabins that you could build for a h 100red,000. but it's more like the land is so expensive too. So ideally if we were going we were paying cash it would be 250. so
Andrew Daniels: Okay. when you did this budget, did this even out pretty equally with what you expect to what your takehome pay?
Miranda Wood: Yeah, I think so. Yeah. I mean, I had put in my taxes on my budget of I took in here's my gross.
Miranda Wood: I took out I had a different form for taxes.
Andrew Daniels: Mhm. Yeah.
Miranda Wood: And then I just kind of worked through I knew what I needed and then it was like, "Okay, here's our bills. What do I have to put towards our extra loans?" what extra quote unquote extra money that people would be like, " this is fun. Let me go spend it." I'm like, "Okay, what loan can I throw this at?" "What …
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Right.
Miranda Wood: so I'm like, ideally, I have it to where if I didn't have an income, Earl could pay all the basics. He could do the rent, the car, groceries, pretty much the bare necessities. And then I am towards the loans.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Right.
Miranda Wood: I am towards, daycare because if I wasn't working, we wouldn't need daycare, things like that. 290 a week.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. I was that daycare.
Andrew Daniels: So that's so expensive. I'm looking at that going, " my gosh, that can't be true.
Miranda Wood: Mhm. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: My gosh, it's so crazy." Yeah.
Miranda Wood: It hurts. So we might be switching her daycare to where it if Earl goes into he got into PhD school. So we might be switching it to…
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Miranda Wood: where he goes to school which is the school daycare which is 235. So there's a chance to a little bit of a break.
Andrew Daniels: So, a little bit of a break there. Yeah. do we expect any expenses from the PhD program? Yeah.
Miranda Wood: But it's still expensive. So he is looking for an assistantship but his program's super weird. Mine I just got it. But they're like here's you get free tuition. His is not like that. So I guess yeah basically so yeah so his is …
Andrew Daniels: That's because your subject matter was so incredibly interesting that they thought they needed to compensate for that.
Miranda Wood: what was 2800 2500 for three credit hours. and so he can do the program as slow or as fast as he wants. I think you have 10 years to go through the program. So, …
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Miranda Wood: it would just be kind of like how many can we feel like we can afford this semester? I'm not going to do it without an assistantship. Yeah, he says he's not doing it without an assistantship, so we're kind of up in the air right now on if that is an expense, if it's It's not going to be an expense. He says it's not going to be an expense. He's like, I'm not going without. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Yeah. Okay.
Andrew Daniels: I'm just gonna put a note in here that's something we might be looking at only with I think so let's take a look. I think I saw after we kind of did a little bit of modification here, we did get the total tax down slightly. There's probably more that I'm going to be able to do and then once I show you guys some of the moves that we could make,…
00:40:00
Andrew Daniels: I think we will be able to squeeze some out of there right now that there's basically four places that you guys can spend taxes, savings, and lifestyle. Right? And when I say lifestyle, I mean all the things that you could choose to do with your money that are not debt, taxes, or savings, right?
Miranda Wood: Good. Yes.
Andrew Daniels: I had one lady argue. She was like, "But I have a business. That's not lifestyle." I'm like, "I get it, but it's not debt, taxes, or savings." So, right, and…
Miranda Wood: Yeah. Mhm.  Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: the reason I put it that way is because what most people will do is they will try to take from their lifestyle in order to squeeze out that extra efficiency. I'm going to try and take from debt and taxes. And even if we can shave two to three% off debt and taxes and put it towards savings, once we start building that savings, I can start generating extra income that you guys don't have to physically show up for. And the earlier you can start the more of a snowball effect that it will have over the long term, this whole 50-year period or whatever, right?
Andrew Daniels: So I'm just curious how our numbers have changed now that we kind of optimized some things. Wait, why are we having a net monthly cash flow of 17. All right. it's very sensitive. You have to put in the right number.
Miranda Wood: Mean does it matter that I guess those are liabilities. So, I guess is it showing the auto loan twice or because it's liability or…
Andrew Daniels: I'll show you a really cool thing All right. So you can go into each year and you have this on your dashboard too. So you can go into the year and…
Andrew Daniels: it will show you exactly what's happening. So in April, what did I do that that causes our expenses? expenses are only at 88. that's why hold on. It was I updated that John Deere retirement account and it thinks you're putting in 19 grand a month.
Miranda Wood: No, I don't know…
Miranda Wood: where you're getting that from.
Andrew Daniels: 6%. That would be nice, I may have to Why does it say that?
Miranda Wood: Yeah, right.
Miranda Wood: So, the offer letter says they do 300 the company matches 300% on the first 2% deferred and 100% on the next 4% deferred.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, perfect.
Miranda Wood: So, Yeah,…
Andrew Daniels: That works. Okay, I'm going to clear that out so we can at least get some kind of real number here. And we'll just put $200 a month as a flat.
Miranda Wood: I think I had done if I did 6% of my wages, it was 207 a month or something like that. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: We'll do that. And I'm just going to do a straight match for now because we know it's at least 100% of the 6%, right? And it's a little bit more after that.
Andrew Daniels: But come on. Update. What in the heck? All right. I got my thing all tangled.
Andrew Daniels: I'm going to work on this. I was hoping I could just click the button, but it's being pnikity with me. yeah,…
Miranda Wood: I was going to say you have your meeting at two,…
Miranda Wood: so you can go. Okay.
Andrew Daniels: but what I'll do with this as well is what we did here. I'm going to push that back into your account so that you can kind of play around with the updated numbers. and I'm guessing that there is something that I put in here somewhere that's tracking through as a cash flow that's coming out like crazy. see if I can find it real quick.
Andrew Daniels: …
Andrew Daniels: I know what it is. Here we go. I put these in monthly contributions, not value. So, that's what was going on. Yeah. let's see. you said there was 400 in that and about 10,000 we go. I had put it in the monthly contribution. So, yay.
Miranda Wood: Okay, that'll definitely 10,000.
Miranda Wood: It's like you do not have this much to you are a drug dealer hiding.
Andrew Daniels: One meeting with me and you're a multi-millionaire. That's impressive.
Miranda Wood: Why do you need me? Yeah. Okay.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. I'll keep fiddling with that and once I get those numbers corrected, I'll push it back to your account. Earl, I did record the first part of our conversation so that you could hear what all we talked about.
00:45:00
Andrew Daniels: And then I'll give me a couple of days to kind of rework this and then I'll shoot you an email.
Andrew Daniels: I'll say, "Hey, it's ready. Take a look at these numbers and then we can schedule another call if you want." Awesome. All right, you guys. This is all it takes. And then every couple of months, we just kind of update and stay on track.
Miranda Wood: Perfect. Sound again.
Miranda Wood: Perfect. I like it. Nice. Okay,…
Andrew Daniels: So, let me know if you guys have any questions if something comes up.
Miranda Wood: sounds good. Thank you. Bye.
Andrew Daniels: right, have a good day. Bye.

Dustin Bundy: whatever. I'm calling her right now.
Andrew Daniels: No worries.

Dustin Bundy: Yeah, we got some storms going on right now here in Oklahoma.
Dustin Bundy: Yeah, the kids stayed home from school today. It's all flooded everywhere.
Andrew Daniels: What? my gosh.
Dustin Bundy: Yeah, we could barely leave our house because it was so flooded.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, that's crazy.

Andrew Daniels: right. No worries.
Dustin Bundy: All right.
Dustin Bundy: She didn't answer, of course. let me see. She's over at the house, but Okay.
Andrew Daniels: And…

Dustin Bundy: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: maybe if you back out of that and to go back through it and then redo the sign up with your email address that probably is easier.
Dustin Bundy: That's what I'm doing now.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Dustin Bundy: And the wind is picking. Okay. come on.
Dustin Bundy: What's going on here? All Okay. Sent me the code. So,
00:10:00

Dustin Bundy: I'm going have to call her for her social real quick.
Andrew Daniels: I might have Hold on. I think I have it in my files.

Andrew Daniels: You would put Okay. is there a company name and email? Really?
Dustin Bundy: …
Dustin Bundy: add individual and it says individual legal name, tax ID or social security number, relationship, address. yeah. So, it said individual. It doesn't say company.

Dustin Bundy: whole ID
Andrew Daniels: So, tax ID is going to be 825151. does it need the whole ID or just the last four? Okay. So, for the tax ID, do 825151.
Andrew Daniels: No, I'm sorry. I changed this. Geez Louise. I've gone through too much stuff and they told me they had changed this so I wouldn't have to do this like this. But no worries. give me a second. I'm pulling up this information. I use my company information. So now it's being super slow. Okay.

Dustin Bundy: You said sweet 200 and phone number,…
Andrew Daniels: 913 372302 Andy Ndyshwalthsolutions.com.
Dustin Bundy: email address.
Andrew Daniels: I'm sorry. No, shwealthLC.com. Geez Louise, I changed that too.
Dustin Bundy: Sherwealth LLC.com.
Andrew Daniels: We're going to choose to do it from the account.
Dustin Bundy: Sherwell LLC.com. it says, "How do you want account fees paid?" Okay.
Andrew Daniels: So, we'll make sure that there's enough in the account to have it come out. Plus, this custodian's a little bit cheaper than Forge Trust. So, Yep.
Dustin Bundy: Ongoing fees will be deducted from cash available in your account. Your $500 minimum cash balance must be maintained. please acknowledge your fee schedule and…
Dustin Bundy: all that. Okay. how will you be funding your account?
Andrew Daniels: Is there an option to say transfer?
Dustin Bundy: Says transfer your existing IRA, roll over your 401k or make a contribution.
Andrew Daniels: We want to transfer the existing IRA.
Dustin Bundy: It says, "You're almost there. Service traditional onetime charge of $50. Total due today $50.
Dustin Bundy: Annual account fee is $495." not that. I mean, I can try to maybe back up and see if I see anything.
Andrew Daniels: And we didn't see any referral org anywhere in there.
Andrew Daniels: Double check for that cuz you're not supposed to be charged 4.90. It's supposed to be like 250. You get a discounted because it's just like a referral code that I have.
Andrew Daniels: So they made sure that your fee is cut in half forever. as long as you But I want to make sure that gets attached. Worst case scenario, I'll call or once we complete this. I'll call the director and get them to adjust it.
Dustin Bundy: this. Okay.
Dustin Bundy: So, I just pushed back, but my I hope it didn't go all the way back. So, it went all the way back to open an account.
Andrew Daniels: Did it save it?
Dustin Bundy: I don't know.
Andrew Daniels: Jeez. All right. I got all my information pulled up.
Andrew Daniels: If we can't figure it out, if we can't find it.
Dustin Bundy: So, I just hit forward button again and went right back to the fee. So okay sign your account pending.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, I guess just continue. I'm glad you're willing to do this with me because I need to understand their process so I can help everybody else. And it is not what I thought it was. So, it doesn't match my instructions either. So, go ahead and continue and let's see if it asks for the referral on a checkout or something like it may ask for it later. Yeah, go ahead and…
Dustin Bundy: Pay your establishment fee Continue sign your document. Okay.
Andrew Daniels: do that because that'll get the whole process started where they'll load it up and…
00:20:00
Dustin Bundy: All right. So, we're preparing document now.
Andrew Daniels: then it should pull up a docu sign u that you can look at. Yeah.
Dustin Bundy: Yeah, it's loading.
Andrew Daniels: And it'll just take all the information you just put in and load it into the docu sign for you.
Dustin Bundy: Yeah. So it says get started. Just making sure everything is good. Favor statements. Beneficiary Dustin Bundy spouse. get started. Account owner signature required. Click Type. insert 430. Okay. Has your stuff in there. Cash duties.
Dustin Bundy: What is this? Yeah, it says annual account fee 4.95,…
Dustin Bundy: transaction fees. So it says government issued photo ID required attachments.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. …
Andrew Daniels: yeah. They're going to Yeah, that's the upload. Yeah, that's normal. that's right.
Dustin Bundy: Okay. I'm going to have to go get her license.
Andrew Daniels: Shoot. I forgot they were doing this.
Andrew Daniels: That's annoying. this part should be fairly set up that you can return to it.
Dustin Bundy: …
Dustin Bundy: I mean,…
Dustin Bundy: I can go get her license and then scan it in.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. …
Andrew Daniels: …
Dustin Bundy: Yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: no, I just wanted to make sure. But you know that you kind of feel confident with this part of the process though, Okay. That's what I wanted to make sure was that we kind of got this part set up because we can't really do much else until the new account is set up. so I think that's probably a good enough stopping point. If you're at the point that you're generating the docu sign, it should be saved so that you can continue it or if you just leave it up like it should just you know what I mean? then the next piece is I'm going to send an email to Laura's email address because they're going to want to see that it came from her email address.
Andrew Daniels: that and it's basically kind of like an all-in-one document and it'll have the transfer paperwork and how it works and this is really important. How it works is we fill out the directed IRA transfer form and…
Andrew Daniels: they contact Forge Trust and they will match all the funds together to link everything over if that makes sense. And so that way you guys don't have to worry about, tracking the taxation on the money or anything like that, that can take couple weeks, right?
Dustin Bundy: Okay.
Dustin Bundy: Right. Okay.  Okay.
Andrew Daniels: that's just is what it is. But that once we kind of release them on that, they'll do their whole process. The rest of the packet is the renewal paperwork for the home path note. And so we're going to say basically renew the 30, add the 12 to it. Your new monthly payment will be whatever 42,000. It'll be 280 a month going in there instead of the 212. So you guys got about 42% 42 and a half percent gains on that last one. So might as well keep it spinning and let that keep growing. that will be the secured capital agreement and then directed IRA's paperwork for making sure that once all the funds are settled and home path has a new closing date, HomePath and directed IRA will then coordinate to make sure that those funds get transferred for the investment.
00:25:00
Andrew Daniels: Does that make sense?
Dustin Bundy: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: So, we're basically going to let all of the companies that we're doing business with, we're going to let them do everything so you guys don't have to track a bunch of papers and checks and everything. other than that, once you get her license loaded up and get that in there, I'm going to call the director as soon as we get off this call. I will call the director that I work with at directed IRA and…
Andrew Daniels: I will let them know to watch for her account so that you guys can get that discounted fee schedule too because you guys should have that. and then you said you had some other questions.
Dustin Bundy: All right.
Dustin Bundy: Let me see here. so I talked to you about, we got that credit card debt and stuff like that that we're trying to figure out.
Andrew Daniels: Uh-huh. Yep.
Dustin Bundy: And then we have the money in my life insurance. so I was thinking, we're just kind of back and forth about what if, we did like a debt consolidation type for our,…
Dustin Bundy: credit cards, through a company that's reputable or whatever, and then save that money that's in the life insurance for just in case, we really need it. because we did,…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah.
Dustin Bundy: like I said, we did lose our big client. we did pick up another client.
Andrew Daniels: I was going to say, didn't you tell me you had another one?
Dustin Bundy: So, we did pick them up. however, it's a small chiropractor, so it's really really nothing,…
Andrew Daniels: Right. Right. Right.
Dustin Bundy: I mean,…
Dustin Bundy: we're not going to be making a lot of money off of them,…
Andrew Daniels: It's not like you can sit back and…
Andrew Daniels: rest at that point.
Dustin Bundy: 
Dustin Bundy: right? Yeah. I mean it was nice to be able to go out and get another client real quick and this be able to say okay hey we did it and the first one's out of in the bag so yeah …
Andrew Daniels: And all you need is the first one and then you can get going from there.
Dustin Bundy: however my question is one like I said we're thinking about doing some type of consolidation loan through for credit cards just so we can kind lump them all into one and…
Dustin Bundy: then kind of keep our funds that we have in life insurance for real emergency.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Mhm.
Dustin Bundy: So we're thinking about that. And then two, because I would hate to, use that money in the life insurance to pay off all those credit cards. And then all of a sudden, we need money to, live and…
Andrew Daniels: Right. Right.
Dustin Bundy: we don't because we just gave all that money to the credit cards.
Andrew Daniels: Yep. Yeah.
Dustin Bundy: The credit cards they've got money. So we can try to pay those off as we can.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Right. Mhm.
Dustin Bundy: But my other thing is let's say god forbid worst case scenario that our finances for a while are getting real tight and we're looking at…
Dustin Bundy: where we can trim the fat in our budget and…
Andrew Daniels: Right.
Dustin Bundy: what if we can't pay this for our life insurance anymore but we have this money in there because it's a thousand $1,200 a month out of account.
Andrew Daniels: So Right.
Dustin Bundy: And I don't want that to happen. I want it to keep going. I'm
Andrew Daniels: So, yeah, I mean, let's talk worst case scenario. ultimately we can cut all the premiums off permanently and still have all the cash value and the death benefits. That is literally the least good option, it's the least not good option, it's the least preferable option.
Dustin Bundy: Right.
Andrew Daniels: Second only to just dropping the policies all together and cashing them out, there are multiple steps we can take before then, right?
Andrew Daniels: One of which, kind of the first one I would guess would be take the cash and pay off the credit card so you can have breathing room in your cash flow and it will build back up over time, right? that would be my preferred option because It allows you to substitute yourself for the bank with all those credit cards. right now. I can agree with you too though of wanting to have some capital where you might want to have a lump sum available. What if you do land a client that requires some initial capital outlay? What if you need 15 grand to hire somebody else or to set up a new system or whatever for a new client that's a really good client?
00:30:00
Dustin Bundy: Mhm.  Right.
Andrew Daniels: The business makes sense, but maybe it's six weeks until you get paid from that, right?
Andrew Daniels: because I know sometimes contracts can take differing lengths to pay out. so on a business mindset side, I would agree that you need to keep some capital for your war chest. Basically, you might have something come along where you're required to get a certification or something. And if you only have that, you have the business, it's $3,000. That would be where you'd use the life insurance money to go get that so that then you can bring in the business, so I think it's very very smart for you to be considering those kinds of options. the debt consolidation, I have a referral for you, a company that I have vetted and I will send you a link that you should absolutely schedule a meeting with them. They will have a whole range of options for you based on all the stuff that you have with them. They'll look at everything. They'll say, "Okay, maybe consolidation here or refinancing a loan over here."
Andrew Daniels: they'll have the spread of that and they're a very very good company. in fact, I met them after I had a client that went and did consolidation…
Dustin Bundy: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: because I didn't have any options for her. We should have gone with my company that I found because the one that she found completely screwed her over and we're trying to get her out of it, but it looks like she's just stuck in it. So, I'm going to send you a referral for that so that you guys can look into that. set a meeting with them. They'll go through all their options. I don't even know everything that they do. but I've talked to the guy that runs the whole thing and he is a solid dude. Everything that I've needed to learn about what he's doing. He's always been responsive. So, it's just one of those things…
Dustin Bundy: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: where water flows from uphill, if the top guys are doing it right, they're probably got some good things going on.
Andrew Daniels: So I think you should look at that because that is another way that we can achieve your goal of keeping your capital accessible but then reducing your cash flow costs if that makes sense. the middle ground to answer your question directly the middle ground of what do we do if we can't keep going? all of the policies were designed, even the kids,…
Dustin Bundy: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: there's this middle ground amount. And this from your perspective, this is your premium. This is what they pull from your bank account every month. This middle ground, there's an additional amount that if business is good, you can fund the policies even further. But then beyond that, there is a bare minimum. If there was financial calamity, right, and you're like, "Hey, we just cannot figure this out.
Andrew Daniels: We've got to get a breather on this. for potentially as long as 23 straight months, we could lower all of those policy premiums down to the minimum with pretty much no adverse effect. You wouldn't lose the ability to put in more or to go back to your average premium. So, we can give you pretty much a two-year break on that anytime you need to.
Andrew Daniels: And then we would combine that do we need to supplement with monthly policy loans, you've got quite a bit of money in there, even if you took a thousand, if we cut the premiums to the bare minimums, and then you started taking an extra $1,000 a month or whatever, most people don't have a financial situation that lasts longer than 12 months.
Dustin Bundy: I'm hoping we can avoid it alto together,…
Andrew Daniels: I mean, that's I mean, And so, I think there's some way Yeah,…
Dustin Bundy: .
Andrew Daniels: And you guys already have that stone starting to roll with getting your next new client. It's going to go from there. you just need to open the gate and the rest will come. I think, maybe that's too woo woo, but every time I get anxious about my business, something happens where I'm like, if I just keep moving forward, things tend to realign.
Dustin Bundy: Yeah. And I mean, we also been talking I might I mean,…
Dustin Bundy: I don't know yet. We'll see. Kind of like I said, we got a month or two to really kind of figure it out, but I might even go back into some type of law enforcement …
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Dustin Bundy: instead of doing medical billing. So, Laura might just keep it.
Andrew Daniels: Who is your ideal client?
Dustin Bundy: So the one that we've grew from seven clients to 150 or…
Andrew Daniels: Who is your client that would be an ideal client for you? Okay. Okay.
Dustin Bundy: seven kids to 150 kids is So ABA therapy is what it's called and typically those are type of offices that can start small and grow very quickly. so that is our kind of our specialty client is ABA therapy.
00:35:00
Andrew Daniels: And that's called ABA therapy. Okay.
Dustin Bundy: Yes. Yep.
Andrew Daniels: Is that an industry term?
Dustin Bundy: Yeah. Yes.
Andrew Daniels: If I said ABA therapy, if you're in the industry, you know what that means?
Dustin Bundy: Yep. No,…
Andrew Daniels: Is it geographically restricted or do you guys do everything all over?
Dustin Bundy: we do everything all over.
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Dustin Bundy: 
Dustin Bundy: Yeah. because we don't even have clients that are in Oklahoma.
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Dustin Bundy: So, yeah.
Andrew Daniels: It's not required.
Dustin Bundy: I mean,…
Andrew Daniels: It's not required for you to be there.
Dustin Bundy: no, except the chiropractor that we just picked up.
Dustin Bundy: He's in a town over from us. So, we actually picked him up by accident…
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Dustin Bundy: because we were having lunch one day and some elderly couple was sitting next to us and we started talking to them and they were like, "Yeah, we gota what do you guys do?" We said medical billing. This was five months ago and…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah.
Dustin Bundy: she I got a chiropractor maybe looking for a biller and we just exchanged numbers and hadn't heard from him in five months and then two weeks ago out of the blue this chiropractor calls Laura and says hey you guys still doing billing and…
Dustin Bundy: we just had a meeting with them last week and then picked them up as a zone. Yeah,…
Andrew Daniels: when you decide what's the price point for so that chiropractor is your price point based on number of patients or…
Andrew Daniels: how do you decide how much to charge them Okay.
Dustin Bundy: it's how much that we collect from the insurance companies is how much we get from the chiropractor or from our client.  So they have let's say 10 kids come in or 10 client or patients come in we charge their insurance and whatever we collect from the insurance that goes back to the chiropractor then he gives us a percentage of
Andrew Daniels: So, it's almost like a merchant almost like a credit card payment.
Andrew Daniels: If I own a retail store, I have to pay the credit I have to pay Square or PayPal 1% of all the people that swipe the card.
Andrew Daniels: 1% of Okay.
Dustin Bundy: Yeah, basically.
Dustin Bundy: And we would be like the credit card company.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. What's the big value? What is your guys's unique selling proposition? Why does somebody choose to work with Dustin and Laura versus anybody else that's out there? Okay.
Dustin Bundy: I think the biggest thing would be our ability to decide what percentage we want to charge. So, we can charge anywhere, from 6 to 12% of a fee for an invoice each month. And so, we decide we go in there, we, figure out monthlies what their yearlies are their collections are. And if we go, we can do a better job than that.
Dustin Bundy: Then we can decide, we want to charge you all the way down to depending on their revenue and how much they're bringing in.
Andrew Daniels: So when you say you can do better than that,…
Andrew Daniels: do you mean that you guys can collect more from the insurance company by making sure all the services are properly coded?
Dustin Bundy: Yes. it's not coded…
Andrew Daniels: That's okay.
Dustin Bundy: because we don't do coding but just by the followup that we do the ability that I said Laura is like a wizard when it comes to medical billing so she's very good at it.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Uh-huh.
Dustin Bundy: She's been doing it for over 20 years. so she can walk into a place like this chiropractor and he printed out the financials for the year and how much they collect and he's only collecting 20ome maybe 25% from these insurance companies with our other clients that we're doing the one that just sold out.
Dustin Bundy: I mean, we're collecting I mean, if I had to guess, it's up to where to 75%.
Andrew Daniels: …
Andrew Daniels: there is value for the practice owner to farm out to you guys…
Dustin Bundy: Yeah. Exactly.
Andrew Daniels: because that practice owner can't do all the followup. Can't track, hey, why did you decline this? You shouldn't have declined This that kind of stuff.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Okay. And it's basically like the squeaky wheel gets the grease,…
Dustin Bundy: 
Dustin Bundy: Yeah. Yeah.
Dustin Bundy: So, we're the company that goes and follows up with the insurance company and make sure they get paid that.
Andrew Daniels: The more you bug them, the more opportunity you have for them to go, "Okay, fine. I'm in a good mood. I'll approve it." Right.
Dustin Bundy: And there's certain ways that you just got to be able to know what you're doing and how to send a claim that's correct and then follow up with it.
Andrew Daniels: Right. Yeah.
Dustin Bundy: And because insurance it's like learning another language.
Andrew Daniels: You can tell what I think about insurance just by the way I talked about,…
Dustin Bundy: And medical insurance it's different than life insurance and stuff like that.
00:40:00
Andrew Daniels: right? Yeah.
Dustin Bundy: Medical billing insurance is like, you got to know all these little different things. and like I said, I don't know them all. I just learned from Laura from when I retired from the police department.
Andrew Daniels: Right. Yeah.
Dustin Bundy: So, Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Are you still on Trenton Avenue? Okay. No, I only asked that because I will keep my ears open. If I find people who I think have relevance to that industry, I will absolutely make some referrals to you guys.
Dustin Bundy: And I appreciate that. yeah, so ABA is applied behavior analysis is what it is.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Yeah.
Dustin Bundy: And they're all over the place. it's just hooking up and finding somebody who's good and trustworthy and doing a good job on their end to where …
Dustin Bundy: we don't get screwed on the other end because the only reason, the ones we did bring on before is because we knew them before we had our own business…
Andrew Daniels: Right. Right.
Dustin Bundy: because Laura had worked for him before and she trusted him, she knew him. it wasn't a fact that we need to go meet with them. We need to make sure they're doing their end right and all that, So, …
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah.
Dustin Bundy: so yeah, so that's the other part of it is meeting the people and making sure they're doing the right thing on their end so they can come back and bite us in the end. So,
Andrew Daniels: One of the things I wanted to ask you, would you consider doing work with chiropra?
Andrew Daniels: I'm not sorry. plastic surgeons.
Dustin Bundy: I don't know.
Dustin Bundy: I would have to ask Laura because we've never done a plastic surgery billing can be used.
Andrew Daniels: But your billing on that can be probably a little bit higher.
Dustin Bundy: And as long as the plastic surgery is they're covered by insurance,…
Andrew Daniels: I do have two I do is that they're not covered in a lot of cases,…
Dustin Bundy: that's the biggest thing.
Andrew Daniels: right? …
Dustin Bundy: Yeah. Because it's not medically necessary.
Andrew Daniels: I see. So, the challenge then would be Why do we need to pay somebody to go fight insurance companies if that's not covered by insurance and we know this isn't like it's all out of pocket anyways?
Dustin Bundy: Yeah. I think that's probably the biggest hiccup with that kind of thing…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah,…
Dustin Bundy: because if the insurance doesn't deem it medically necessary, it's just Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: you're not there's nothing anybody's going to say to get them to change their mind.
Dustin Bundy: Yeah. Exactly.
Andrew Daniels: Yep.
Dustin Bundy: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: So, I only asked that because I have two friends from college who run their own plastic surgery practices and the aesthetics and plastic surgery. So, maybe throw that out to Laura and…
Andrew Daniels: if you guys want a referral. I can make an email introduction to each of them to you guys and that can be something you can explore with them if it even makes sense. Otherwise, I'll keep thinking on it.
Dustin Bundy: Okay. …
Dustin Bundy: yeah, I appreciate that. So, Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: No. Okay. And that helps me to know a little bit more about what you guys do and how you do it. So that way I can look for, who in my network does that kind of work and might be able to use your services.
Dustin Bundy: Yeah, that'd be great. And like I said, I mean our specialty is the ABA therapy.
Andrew Daniels: Right. Right. that's your bread and butter.
Andrew Daniels: and you guys,…
Dustin Bundy: Yeah. Right.
Andrew Daniels: if that's where you're good at, you probably shouldn't try to stray too far from that because it's almost like starting up a new business at that point. stay with…
Dustin Bundy: Right. Exactly.
Andrew Daniels: what because that's where you can make the money. Okay. Okay.
Andrew Daniels: No, I appreciate you going through that because that'll help me kind of just keep it on top of my mind.
Dustin Bundy: And I appreciate that.
Andrew Daniels: I'm gonna Yeah.
Dustin Bundy: Yes.
Andrew Daniels: I'm gonna show this to you just in case Laura has any questions. This is the one that she needs to sign. and I'll just run through this. I've filled all the information. Can you see my screen share, by the way? I filled all the information. There's going to be some blanks on some of these forms because either the the new custodian or home path, depending on which form it is, they will have to fill out their part of it, too.
Andrew Daniels: So, I think the easiest thing to do is to just verify that I've got all the information correct here. and then, there'll be signature places where she can put her signature on there. this is the renewal. I'm going to keep it at a flat 12 because Whoops,…
Dustin Bundy: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: that should be here. I'm going to keep it at a flat 12 because That'll allow enough cash in there to cover the fees until the interest payments start coming in. got all your guys' stuff in here. going for 8% paid monthly. So, we'll do the same kind of thing as last time. and I put in there not applicable for an IRA just to know that we're not worried about that section. She'll sign this part.
00:45:00
Dustin Bundy: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: And all of these forms except for the directed IRA.
Andrew Daniels: They're the same ones that you guys did last time, but I know it was five years ago, so who knows if you even remember and then the biggest one is so for this direction of investment, Home Path does have to go in and add all the note information. They won't have that available until they receive their secured capital agreement and they come back to us. What happens though is all of these documents, they come straight back to me. It's not going on to the companies.  And as I see the process kind of metriculate, I'm not going to submit everything all at once. I'll wait until the funds are at the new custodian and confirm that they're available. Then I'll send the secured capital agreement. Once Home Path gets back to us with a counter signed agreement, then I submit the direction of investment.
Andrew Daniels: So, a lot of this is just helping you guys get it all done at once, and then you guys know that I'm waiting…
Andrew Daniels: until each step of the process is complete and correct before I do the next set of paperwork. Hopefully, that makes sense. And if she has questions on it, you guys can always call me.
Dustin Bundy: Okay. Yeah.
Dustin Bundy: And then you just email it to her.
Andrew Daniels: Yes, it should be in her email now.
Dustin Bundy: And then I'll go do that.
Dustin Bundy: I'll go let her know. Then I got to get her ID uploaded into 44 44
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, it's a little bit of shuffling around,…
Andrew Daniels: but honestly, how old are you now? 39. 44. Yeah, it feels like crazy right now, but you guys are trying to do a lot of stuff. You're trying to get your kids launched and into life and all that. You're trying to run a business.
Andrew Daniels: everybody else that I have who's at a similar stage of life as you has and we're doing these kinds of things where you've got your insurance bunded up. We're doing some outside, you guys are getting 200 bucks a month right now from Home Path and we're about to bump that up, at some point what will happen is we're going to get more income coming into your personal system with these third payers and we're going to continue that. But 44 to 60, what is that? 16 years, a lot's going to happen and you're going to grow that snowball to the point that in your 60s it's going to be okay. this will work out.
Andrew Daniels: and that retirement analyzer that I use.
Andrew Daniels: I mean, that's the best way that we can track it right now. I know you don't have a lot of capacity. I'm not super concerned even with the road bumps. This is just kind of welcome to being an entrepreneur. Push through it. you guys will make it. But I can tell you this, at 44, you have a much better foundation than most people ever get to by the time they're 65. And so, that just gives you all that time to work on it and grow it and keep nurturing it.
Dustin Bundy: Yeah. Right.
Dustin Bundy: Yeah. …
Dustin Bundy: I appreciate that. And yeah, we just keep moving forward. That's all we can do.
Andrew Daniels: Yep. I think so.
Andrew Daniels: I think so. any other questions? Anything else you got that's top of mind?
Dustin Bundy: No, I don't think so.
Andrew Daniels: Little bit of administrative shuffling here and then we'll be set it and forget it. And I'll look through my little rolodex of who I've got and I'll kind of pay attention on Facebook to all my friends. I don't know. I had a ton of people.
Andrew Daniels: I went to UMKC and they had a six-year med program. I have a ton of contacts who are in the medical field. and so I'll try to start watching out and seeing who I can throw your way.
Dustin Bundy: I appreciate that.
Dustin Bundy: And yeah, and also I don't know if you've already sent it to her, the company that you're talking about for the reconsol or the consolidation loan or whatever. yeah,…
Andrew Daniels: Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
Dustin Bundy: 
Dustin Bundy: I appreciate that information, too. just to kind of meet with them and see what they could do.
Andrew Daniels: They don't charge for any of the initial meetings or anything. It's just a consult. you should have it in your text message. I sent you a link.
Dustin Bundy: Yeah. All right. Got it. awesome, hey, I appreciate your help and I'm going to get this stuff done and have her get all that and I'll text you when we're all done.
Andrew Daniels: Absolutely. I'll watch for it.
Andrew Daniels: did notify me once you click that finalized button.
Andrew Daniels: But yeah, no, I'm in it to win it with you, Until you die or I do.
Dustin Bundy: All right.
Dustin Bundy: I appreciate it.
Andrew Daniels: You got me. I'm gonna stick to you white on rice. So, all right.
Dustin Bundy: Sounds good. I appreciate it.
Andrew Daniels: Have a great afternoon. Bye.
Dustin Bundy: You, too.

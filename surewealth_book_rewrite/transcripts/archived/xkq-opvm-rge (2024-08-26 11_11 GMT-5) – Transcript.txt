Wendy Barbe: His best bet is to file bankruptcy because the credit card companies have been playing so many games.
Andrew Daniels: My Down. I'm gonna send you.
Wendy Barbe: So yeah, we went to a gun show this weekend and Cash. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: I'm my gosh. Yeah. Right.
Wendy Barbe: Big time.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, your full retirement. Age is 67 and…
Wendy Barbe: Okay, 67.
Andrew Daniels: you said it was. 3040 at 70? Okay, so
Wendy Barbe: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: what we need to do then is we'll just do this. So just for future reference, we want to gather the fra age and the FRA age would be, that's pretty close. Yeah, I was right there. I've done this before.
Wendy Barbe: Yes, you have just a few times.
Andrew Daniels: 3,040. Right there. 2450. So, what that does is that says, here's the,…
Wendy Barbe: 2450. Okay.
Andrew Daniels: Here's the full retirement age, but then this program will let us kind of quickly, choose a Social Security amount based on the age that you want to take it.
Wendy Barbe: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: And so that can be really helpful as we, let's see what age do we want to take it? let's say we take it at 62 when you plan on leaving your current job,
Wendy Barbe: It's not gonna happen, I mean. Okay good. Yeah, I keep trying to tell myself it's not happening because I need to Manage my expectations. I maybe need to stop managing my expectations and…
Andrew Daniels: And I don't know like you said. Yes. I yeah.
Wendy Barbe: tackle, right?
Andrew Daniels: Let's just start there. If that's what you want to do and then we'll see if we can make it work and if not then we have to kind of adjust. But at least this will give us the bottom line number on what you were expecting.
Wendy Barbe: Right. Right.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, so on the assets tab, let's see how we did here. So we've got traditional Ira and that is Pre-tax money. It's probably not in checking.
Wendy Barbe: Yep.
Andrew Daniels: What is it with bonds money markets? Okay.
Wendy Barbe: It's a mix. So it's about 40% bonds, about five percent fixed, and then the rest of it sucks. And that one has looking at the stock market right now.
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Wendy Barbe: I'm almost tempted to pull it back, completely to bonds.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, or even cash. I guess.
Wendy Barbe: I can't cash.
Andrew Daniels: That's
Wendy Barbe: Okay, I could do it to a secure thing. I think there might be a secured option.
Andrew Daniels: I mean, just the cash account at the IRA, You wouldn't take it out, you would just say, Hey, put it in cash right now.
Wendy Barbe: Right where it's making 1% interest. But it's guaranteed 1% interest.
Andrew Daniels: yeah, for
Wendy Barbe: Especially if I'm looking at three years. Most of the gains came in the last year,…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah.
Wendy Barbe: they posted 13 14 percent the last year because I haven't moved it, almost no fees but
Andrew Daniels: But holy cow. We like that's lucky, we couldn't have predicted that and we want to make sure that, five years now
Wendy Barbe: That's So that's one of my first jobs in. So four, one K. I need to move that to secure. You think completely
Andrew Daniels: Something that has less of a chance of loss. I think yeah,…
Wendy Barbe: Okay, secured.
Andrew Daniels: your stage right now. The number one thing you want to do preserve…
Wendy Barbe: Is prevent loss.
Andrew Daniels: what you yeah.
Wendy Barbe: Yeah, especially in Where I have no control over what the money is doing.
Andrew Daniels: …
Andrew Daniels: and you don't need to be worried.
Wendy Barbe: Until I leave my employer.
Andrew Daniels: I promise I have some ways to show you. we're gonna crank that thing up with earnings but they're gonna be guaranteed and safe, they're not going to be exposed to any kind of loss, so. Keep…
Wendy Barbe: Exactly. Yeah. I get that.
Andrew Daniels: what you have until we finish our conversation and you at least know what's available. you wouldn't believe it.
Wendy Barbe: Right. Exactly.
Andrew Daniels: The number of people I've had who while we were talking, the weeks that we were trying to get everything figured out, they had a 30 50 60,000 loss. Myself.
Wendy Barbe: Yep.
Wendy Barbe: Mm- I actually got really lucky the first time the stock market hit, what was it 5,000 right before? That bubble in '09. I was looking at that going.
Andrew Daniels: .
Wendy Barbe: This is stupid money. And I pulled everything out of the high-risk stuff.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah.
Wendy Barbe: And two weeks later it went off the wall.
Andrew Daniels: good for you. my gosh.
Wendy Barbe: I didn't pull everything, but I pulled about as 75% of it, out of the higher risk stuff. and it's like Yeah that could have been a bad move,…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Wow.
Wendy Barbe: but yeah, I got to keep but then with the medical stuff and my husband's death life, got stupid anyway, regardless Right.
Andrew Daniels: No Still happened. Yeah, no, I understand that.
Wendy Barbe: At least had enough to keep. Yeah, that's what paid the house off the first time. So I'll shut up and…
Andrew Daniels: Okay. No, no,…
Wendy Barbe: yeah, it is.
Andrew Daniels: that's good. This is all good. I mean, it's just good to know that you've got in. Here's the thing, I find that most people, and I don't know if I told you this but most people don't want to do something different, unless they've experienced the pain of that long and…
Wendy Barbe: Yeah. Yeah, I've screwed up.
Andrew Daniels: it sounds like you have a nearness
Wendy Barbe: On that. What? I? Yeah, definitely some of the other things I've screwed up royally. So, yeah.
Andrew Daniels: That's okay. I do, have a way to kind of overcharge this with extra earnings but you don't need to risk any of it right now. There is absolutely no reason for that. Now, you are 58, right? And you turn,…
00:05:00
Wendy Barbe: Yes.
Andrew Daniels: 59 and a half. Let's see, 66 What was your birthday in March? Okay. Yeah.
Wendy Barbe: March. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: So, you'll be 59 next year, and then six months from that, September of next year, you will have,…
Wendy Barbe: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: you will have access if you don't already. A lot of times Companies, allow Where's my assets? There we go. Hold on, we're going back. Yes, I said, Sorry, I'm clicking around. A lot of times companies will have…
Wendy Barbe: It's okay.
Andrew Daniels: what we call in service distribution rules. Where if you're over 55.
Wendy Barbe: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: They will allow you to transfer your ira's. this is Ira is that a account or is that a private account somewhere that you've got? with just Okay, yep.
Wendy Barbe: I'm sorry, it's a 401k. How did that come through? I don't know how that came through as an IRA but that's 401k Okay. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Doesn't get into that level so that's okay. Still seeing pre-tax is just good to know what happens is. They'll allow you to do a over 55 and in most companies, they'll allow what's called an service distribution. It is a free penalty free rollover. to what's called a self-directed account, which means now who's in control, if it's self-directed, Wendy's in control.
Wendy Barbe: Okay, that is actually wonderful. I can pull that off…
Andrew Daniels: yeah,…
Wendy Barbe: Because…
Andrew Daniels: and now you don't have to
Wendy Barbe: if I'm stuck working there for another five years, I found out The only way to get it out if you're younger than that, is to just fly out quit.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, no. And We're not gonna accelerate that just for this, either at 59 and a half, so we'll have to just look at their benefits rules. If they allow an in-service distribution,…
Wendy Barbe: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: you can put that into an IRA account where there's no tax implications and…
Wendy Barbe: Right.
Andrew Daniels: You can keep participating, which is great. Do they match? Okay, let's 6%.
Wendy Barbe: Yes, 6%. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, let's put that in there. So your contributions are 467 a month. Is that right?
Wendy Barbe: Yes. Which is the six percent.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, and they're Okay, I was gonna say so then they're contributing 6% as well. That's great.
Wendy Barbe: And I'm getting pitiful returns obviously.
Andrew Daniels: That's right. we're gonna solve that and this is great because the d85 so you got four to five years.
Wendy Barbe: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: We're gonna, this is cool. This is sweet spot time. If you had waited two,…
Wendy Barbe: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: more years to have this conversation, it would be a little more difficult.
Wendy Barbe: The other thing I can buy their company stock at a 10% discount.
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Wendy Barbe: Never done. It, don't know exactly how the rules work on that, but that's another potential…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Mmm.
Wendy Barbe: where you bring it in and sell it right away. As soon as you hit that you get the stock today, you can sell it the next day and make 10%.
Andrew Daniels: Would you be vested right away too? Really.
Wendy Barbe: Hell yeah. I've been there 10 years. Yeah. but,…
Andrew Daniels: okay, so they don't care how long,…
Andrew Daniels: how long you've purchased
Wendy Barbe: The laboratory directors,…
Wendy Barbe: the one that told me to do it that way.
Andrew Daniels: Wow, that's pretty cool. So We do have a little bit of an arbitrage here in that You can basically get a 10% bump one day to the next That's nuts.
Wendy Barbe: Exactly.
Andrew Daniels: Are there any limits on a dollar amounts of what you can do?
Wendy Barbe: I will have to find out.
Andrew Daniels: I would love to understand more about the rules on that because that is a cool opportunity if you can do that. I mean getting a 10% bump even on five grand is great are on tenure like that is awesome.
Wendy Barbe: Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, let's see. We've got a 1099 interest account that's checking is that just like savings account or something. Okay,…
Wendy Barbe: Yeah, just saving checking. There's not much in…
Andrew Daniels: yeah, so it says value 400,…
Wendy Barbe: it's pretty pathetic.
Andrew Daniels: but monthly contributions 4600, should those be switched.
Wendy Barbe: No 4,600 is my paycheck every month.
Andrew Daniels: But as that's not building up into this account. Okay.
Wendy Barbe: That's not built. No. I keep having money trades for it and I keep pulling it back out trying to catch up with the credit cards.
Andrew Daniels: We're expenses. Okay, so we're gonna calculate that move on another part of the program, but I get…
Wendy Barbe: Okay. Yeah. Right.
Andrew Daniels: I get what you're doing. So I'm gonna leave the 400 in there just because it shows that you've got, 400 bucks on average, maybe available to you.
Wendy Barbe: Yeah, yeah usually yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Wendy Barbe: When I don't get stuck sitting in a place station in my area or…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Right.
Wendy Barbe: in Orlando.
Andrew Daniels: Just now
Wendy Barbe: Yeah, a little Yeah, just yeah, this last month might see.
Andrew Daniels: So Any brokerage money or anything? that's outside of your work plan. Okay, that's okay.
Wendy Barbe: Now.
Andrew Daniels: And any Roth accounts. Okay, and…
Wendy Barbe: No. I wish.
Andrew Daniels: you said, you have worked at The same company for a pretty long time, do you have any 401ks or…
00:10:00
Wendy Barbe: Ten years.
Andrew Daniels: IRAs left over from any other companies or you probably access those when you had to earlier? Yeah.
Wendy Barbe: No, no. Yeah, when the bills got completely out of hand out when he was so sick. Yeah, that's when we,…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. No worries.
Wendy Barbe: we wiped out most of it,
Andrew Daniels: No worries. okay.
Wendy Barbe: It's okay. there's worries…
Wendy Barbe: but it's just…
Andrew Daniels: There is worries.
Wendy Barbe: where we're at.
Andrew Daniels: So when you think about how much money you want to have liquid and available at any given time, what's your dollar amount going forward? if you could set a goal like this is how much I want available available or emergency.
Wendy Barbe: I'd say about 5,000. That should do most things including…
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Wendy Barbe: since I know a car dealer replacing a used car. If I had to in a hurry, Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. let's see, you've got about three to five years before having to take withdrawals. And this is if we target 62, And I'm going to set the target at 62.
Wendy Barbe: Right.
Andrew Daniels: So we can even just see if it's possible and then we'll figure everything out from there.
Wendy Barbe: I know That's okay. We'll see how bad it is.
Andrew Daniels: Sometimes you'd be surprised but don't underestimate some of the tools I've got because I've got some fun stuff that can make a difference.
Wendy Barbe: All right. That would be really fun stuff.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, what statement describes best? How you feel about risk? I don't want to see the principal decrease, I can't afford a significant loss regardless, if my interest rate stays the same, I don't want to exposure. If I can make moderate interest, then I can withstand fluctuations, or I want to invest for high return than I want to take on risk.
Wendy Barbe: And that answer may change but I think right now we're up more like I really can't afford to take too many risks. The moment,…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah.
Wendy Barbe: kind of got myself in a bind a year from now that answer might be totally different but
Andrew Daniels: I would agree. So A or B. I don't want to see the principal amount decrease.
Wendy Barbe: Yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. What would be a reasonable interest rate for you to earn? What do you think is acceptable? four to six, seven to nine, nine to 11 or greater,
Wendy Barbe: I'm okay the loan I've got right now the money that's liquid is six percent. So that's probably, I don't know.
Andrew Daniels: You mean They're charging Okay, what do you think is a good rate for you to earn on your investments?
Wendy Barbe: What they're charging me.
Wendy Barbe: I think long-term six or seven would be awesome, but
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Yeah.
Wendy Barbe: that hopefully isn't too high of a risk but still gets a reasonable. something coming in,
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, I said, I'm gonna turbo charge you so that we don't have to worry about the risk thing at all. So now here's some scenarios on a hundred thousand dollars.
Wendy Barbe: Right.
Andrew Daniels: Best cases, a hundred as a $2,000 gain with zero loss, Or a 4,000 gain with a four thousand dollar loss, eight with an eight 12 of the 12 or 16, what would be the scenario that you'd want to see.
Wendy Barbe: The thought of actually having a hundred thousand dollars to even do that with this.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Wendy Barbe: Yeah. I'll be honest, eight sounds awfully tempting, but I don't know…
Andrew Daniels: Uh-huh.
Wendy Barbe: if the risk is worth it at this point. I'm kind of.
Andrew Daniels: Right to go from a hundred. Not to 88.
Wendy Barbe: Eight. Yeah, that's not that bad in all honesty. That's not that a horrible of a risk.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Yeah.
Wendy Barbe: I mean what I mean, it depends on the thing that's
Wendy Barbe: For that type of return. I think that's fairly reasonable. Honestly.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, so yeah, we'll say 8,000, gain with an 8,000 loss, and by the way, I'm gonna get you 8000 without the lost piece. We could you just that one thing today?
Wendy Barbe: Thank That would be very nice. But yeah, yeah.
Andrew Daniels: okay.
Andrew Daniels: But your average has been on that 401k account.
Wendy Barbe: Honestly, looking at it this year, I know was 13% they were making it, they were Bragging about that. But it looks to me look more like it was about four percent for the last three to four percent or…
Andrew Daniels: Right. Okay.
Wendy Barbe: and a couple of years that were like 2020 was yeah,…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Look,…
Wendy Barbe: all the way around.
Andrew Daniels: let's leave it at four and then I'm gonna show you something because let's do the numbers. This will be a great exercise to show…
Wendy Barbe: Yes.
Andrew Daniels: how we can look at what somebody's actual returns are a lot of …
Wendy Barbe: I'm trying to see if I can even see the screen sharing. So small,…
Andrew Daniels: is it?
Wendy Barbe: it's hard to. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, all of us women when I get it open,
Wendy Barbe: And maybe if I go the other way, we'll Flip.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, just let me know. if it doesn't. Look correct.
Wendy Barbe: 
Wendy Barbe: Hey a sec. Let me try. I usually don't let this thing auto rotate because it gets stupid.
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Wendy Barbe: Okay, that will improve matters considerably right there.
Andrew Daniels: Does that look a little bit better on the screen?
Wendy Barbe: Yeah, that looks better and…
Andrew Daniels: Can we see your client portal?
Wendy Barbe: if I take you take us off the screen. maybe not that.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, you don't need to see my face.
Wendy Barbe: Just no,…
Andrew Daniels: My face isn't important. Let's look at the numbers.
00:15:00
Wendy Barbe: it got better. It took me off the screen and just left the numbers up,…
Andrew Daniels: Okay, so when you log in,…
Wendy Barbe: That's good. Okay.
Andrew Daniels: I just sent you an email link to the login,…
Wendy Barbe: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: that is the full backend of this. So this is what people see from the client perspective, What you and I were just going through, was the agent perspective. So I just want to give you insight, as you talk to people. This is what they get from me. So I'm gonna do my little soliloquy, a side comments on…
Wendy Barbe: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: what we're doing, but then you also get to go through it as I would do with anybody because I think it's really important that people get to see their numbers and how things matriculate. So this is just,…
Wendy Barbe: Right.
Andrew Daniels: this is just the dashboard and then if we click into the financial plan, you'll see a little shortened and I'll zoom in here, you'll see a little shortened version, you don't have all the buttons that I would have but you have all these hats. So you'll be able to see your income tab as I've put it through, you can see our Social Security that we just worked on. And then we go to assets. This is where we were working on your 401k numbers. You can pull up information about that…
Wendy Barbe: Right.
Andrew Daniels: if you adjust your contributions, you can change that in here, We see that we've got tax options on that with rmd's ages.
Wendy Barbe: Yep.
Andrew Daniels: So we're gonna track all of that, we're gonna know up front. When you turn 73, How much money are you going to be required to pay taxes on out of that, pre-tax money. We're gonna know that almost 15 years ahead of time.
Wendy Barbe: yeah, which means that you have to escrow that money back because you're going you don't have to okay,…
Andrew Daniels: Right.
Wendy Barbe: do you have to pay but you don't pay all of that at one time unless you choose to
Andrew Daniels: It's so the rmv basically what it is is if they're gonna let you build up a huge balance of hundreds of thousands of dollars tax over the course of your life.
Wendy Barbe: Right.
Andrew Daniels: It's a way that they force you to start taking a percentage withdrawal so that you have to start paying taxes on the money,…
Wendy Barbe: Right. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: they want the tax money,…
Andrew Daniels: that's what they want.
Wendy Barbe: Of…
Wendy Barbe: of course.
Andrew Daniels: But those rms are important…
Andrew Daniels: because sometimes a lot of times I run into people who have an overfunded 401k. It's too much in the retirement account, which is a weird concept. I don't think anybody's ever thought of and they're forced to take out so much money that it causes their social security to become provisionally, taxable, which up to 80% of the Social Security check then becomes taxable income. So If you get thousand dollars,…
Wendy Barbe: So, if you get three thousand,
Andrew Daniels: 800 of that is taxable income. Now,
Wendy Barbe: That sucks.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, so there is a way in a lot of cases. the more the more money, you get back, the more money you make, it's a little bit harder to do it, but there are ways that we can minimize the tax impact of that. And, you're probably going to be right on the line depending on how long you are contributing. Just overall funds to your savings situation, whether or not you leave the company you're currently at 62, if you're contributing funds until you're 72 or 73 because you're just active like that and you're just throwing it away because you don't need it, saving it, for whatever. There might be some ways that we can convert some of that money. Get a tax deal on it up front and then you'll never get taxes on it.
Wendy Barbe: Yeah. Right.
Andrew Daniels: That's our ultimate goal.
Wendy Barbe: But the other thing is also, it's like, you take them 6% match, if you can control it, but then The rest of it,…
Andrew Daniels: 
Wendy Barbe: I need to be investing elsewhere.
Andrew Daniels: And we'll set it up so that you have that flexibility and liquidity, where you can like with the life insurance contracts, you'll be able to put it in there and now you own your source of capital. So when you do need to buy a new car, you're not asking anybody for it.
Wendy Barbe: What? Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: You call up your old 90 year old self and you say Wendy, I need some money. Can I have some money?
Wendy Barbe: I need to borrow this for you short term. I'll get it back. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: that conversation looks a lot different than your home equity. You just go. Yeah, sure self. I love you. Okay. Yeah.
Wendy Barbe: Yeah. You just gotta make sure you're not wasting, but then again, you got to call somebody else to do it.
Andrew Daniels: Right.
Wendy Barbe: So there's a little balance and check there, that's good.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, no, I think. And what I find is, as we set it up, I'll help you stay between the guardrails.
Wendy Barbe: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: We'll do it correctly. And at some point you will be pulling from your savings just to live on and…
Andrew Daniels: it won't be a big deal.
Wendy Barbe: Yeah, exactly.
Wendy Barbe: But right now it's not non-starters.
Andrew Daniels: So we got a couple more years. Okay, so I flipped in, I'm gonna save that tab. And I'm gonna flip back over to the agent side because I just wanted to have.
Wendy Barbe: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: No, there was a reason why I showed you that. Hold on a second. I'm gonna let this screen share switch. Okay, so we're back at the dashboard. What I wanted to show you was over here on the left,…
Wendy Barbe: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: we have this docu tracker.
Wendy Barbe: Okay. Yeah,…
Andrew Daniels: I don't know if you can see that menu on the left there.
Wendy Barbe: I can. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, so if you click on that Docute Tracker, you'll see that there's a bunch of files already ready for you.
00:20:00
Wendy Barbe: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: Here, let me zoom it in real quick.
Wendy Barbe: Yeah, exactly.
Andrew Daniels: There you go. I think if I do it like that, we'll be able to see it.
Andrew Daniels: And this is basically a spot where you can keep anything that's important to you. This has been very helpful when I've had clients that have gone through the process with me. And they've gone all the way to the point that they're 88 years old and they pass away. I had a guy, his daughter called me said, Hey, do you know anything about my dad situation? Do you know where his stuff's at I had had him upload most things that we talked about into this document tracker and I was able to just give her the login to this so she could get access to anything she needed. Yeah, so on your benefits statements…
Wendy Barbe: Yeah, that'd be nice.
Andrew Daniels: where was you can do investment account statements on your 401K. if you put the most recent statement in there, I'll do a video for you and I'll show you how I use the calculators to determine what your actual return has been. And that is what we call the internal rate of return. Not necessarily just the arithmetic, average is a little misleading and that's what they use on. Those statements to say, 13% will if you think about it, the reason why you don't actually have 13% more money, it's kind of like if you add 50% and then you lose a hundred percent and then you add 50% and you lose 100%. You're actually back at the same dollar amount you started with right and
Wendy Barbe: Yeah, I know and it's like I'm looking at that dead,…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Wendy Barbe: get mad because I know the money's been going in there for Eight years and…
Andrew Daniels: yeah, and It doesn't math,…
Wendy Barbe: it's like, yeah.
Andrew Daniels: it's not matching up but they're telling you, it's a 13% return. That's a trick of arithmetic averages. And what I can do is I'll take that statement and…
Wendy Barbe: Right.
Andrew Daniels: I'll go through and I'll show you how we can do the true return.
Wendy Barbe: Right. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: That's a weighted average that actually takes each year's return and then gives you an actual number. I don't know like that,…
Wendy Barbe: Right.
Andrew Daniels: but it's gonna be a good process for you to see
Wendy Barbe: Yeah, no. I need to see it and I already knew something was what in Denmark? So?
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, yeah. So let's switch back here and
Wendy Barbe: Although, I guess Maybe I'm not doing as bad as I thought because that's only been going in there for about eight years. So,
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, no I think you've got a really great foundation with this savings. I'm sure it definitely helps that they've got a 6% match. So if we can finagle it, I'd love to see you continue to do that because that's just free money. I think, most people take the free money and we know…
Wendy Barbe: Right.
Andrew Daniels: what to do with it. Once it's under your control.
Wendy Barbe: Yeah, if they've got the thing where I can put it in a self-directed account. If they don't that,…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. …
Wendy Barbe: I'm gonna have to look at maybe not doing the Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: then we just wait a year and a half next September. You'll be 59 and a half and they have to let you take it and you can still participate. So from 59 and a half, we just start that growth going from there.
Wendy Barbe: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: so this advanced expense plan, we can just run through this real quick and what you'll see are those showing up properly or do you need a zoom in Okay,…
Wendy Barbe: They're working good. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: we have just all the different expenses and This software, pulls the inflation rate from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. So what we want that question, we're trying to answer here is based on your current expenses 30 years from now, is the income gonna be enough? And the real question is five years from now will,…
Wendy Barbe: Right.
Andrew Daniels: will the income cover the expenses. So …
Wendy Barbe: Right, which right now obviously isn't happening but we're working on that. I'm sorry.
Andrew Daniels: you can always cover or you can always adjust this.
Wendy Barbe: And I'm looking at the 3% inflation. Just laughing my ass off but anyway,
Andrew Daniels: And so let me show you here down at the bottom…
Wendy Barbe: Sorry, the last three years,…
Andrew Daniels: where it's
Wendy Barbe: you're not resemble, three percent inflation.
Andrew Daniels: No, no they update it when the Bureau of Labor statistics stuff comes out. Let me see where it.
Wendy Barbe: Yeah, but they don't put stuff like food in there.
Andrew Daniels: Clear. Yeah.
Wendy Barbe: So it's kind of like,…
Wendy Barbe: or gas
Andrew Daniels: Here's the historical.
Andrew Daniels: Inflation rates going all the way back to 1914. And so we can look at you…
Wendy Barbe: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: they've got 3 in there. 2022 is pretty high, six twenty twenty one was pretty high so that six and seven percent over the annual
Wendy Barbe: Yeah, but I think they took a couple of things out of there. So they wouldn't show up food and stuff. So, we are not comparing apples to apples here at all.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, yeah, let's see. I don't know if they use the chain CP. I'm not sure exactly. Which CPI they're using. Let's see. If we can US inflation, calculator is where they get this from. so this CPI actually, okay, they changed it. They stopped using the Bureau of Labor Statistics and now they're using a consumer. Looks like a third party inflation calculator which includes all of these things, food at home, food away from gas fuel electricity.
00:25:00
Wendy Barbe: Okay, all real numbers.
Andrew Daniels: So this Yeah.
Wendy Barbe: Okay, not the labor of statistics,…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. That might be why they did.
Wendy Barbe: they did because they started taking stuff like food and energy out.
Andrew Daniels: Uh-huh, you have to stop me out by
Wendy Barbe: So the employee So it wouldn't look like we were in inflation when we massively were
Andrew Daniels: So I'm glad you asked that because I thought they were still using the beer of labor statistics but now they're using a third party company that actually has its own tracking. that considers …
Wendy Barbe: And that looks a lot like…
Andrew Daniels: looks like
Wendy Barbe: what I've been seeing around here right there? Much more accurate. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, this is much. More accurate. So that's why I like This company they keep us on our toes, they'll change stuff like that. They update all the tax stuff, anytime new tax laws. Come out. It's updated automatically. So, we'll know,…
Wendy Barbe: Nice.
Andrew Daniels: obviously we don't know what taxes are gonna look like in 2036, but at the end of this year, when that tax law goes back, this is all going to get updated. And all our numbers are gonna change automatically.
Wendy Barbe: At least we have the best information available.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, yeah. Okay, so let's see. Mortgage principal and interest.
Wendy Barbe: That's going to be 11:15 11. Yeah, 11,15. It does.
Andrew Daniels: Is that include taxes and insurance? Okay, let's split those off. what? Your taxes and insurance.
Wendy Barbe: That was an. Insurance was 155. Yeah. Sorry I knew I was gonna end up with a question. I couldn't answer.
Andrew Daniels: That's okay.
Wendy Barbe: All right, where's it at this? Pila
Wendy Barbe: I'll see total monthly escrow is 366. So if you take out 155, what's that 210? That sounds about right actually.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, to 11.
Wendy Barbe: 210 to 11 for taxes. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: All right, so that means your payment is 749. And then how many years left? Do we have on the primary mortgage?
Wendy Barbe: It's the only mortgage 15. the one I signed this week is the only mortgage Right.
Andrew Daniels: This is the one you're just doing just now. Okay. Okay.
Wendy Barbe: Yes, that's it. I had the place free and…
Wendy Barbe: clear, but What 29% on credit cards,…
Andrew Daniels: I got it.
Andrew Daniels: I got it.
Wendy Barbe: this made way more sense.
Andrew Daniels: So we're gonna say that that comes due ine of 15 years. nine of twenty nine.
Wendy Barbe: 15 years. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: No home equity loan. Is that technically what this is?
Wendy Barbe: No, they literally listened through as a horse mortgage. I didn't qualify for a home equity line.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, that's almost even better. So you're not gonna be able to move money back in and out of it. Okay, all right. That's
Wendy Barbe: No. I asked about that, they said I absolutely didn't qualify for that.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, okay,…
Andrew Daniels: so we got it.
Wendy Barbe: then I tried to get just the home,…
Wendy Barbe: just under the cover that credit cards and got told it was easier to get a hundred thousand dollars…
Andrew Daniels: Uh-huh.
Wendy Barbe: which didn't quite turn out to be true then it was to get 25. So yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Okay yeah. Yeah. Any homeowners association news? Okay. Delete that.
Wendy Barbe: No.
Andrew Daniels: Rental insurance. What is your utilities your gas and electric
Wendy Barbe: It's about 450 a month right now, and I think I can do better than that. I think.
Andrew Daniels: How about water and sewer or does that include? Okay.
Wendy Barbe: Mike, that's a hundred bucks. A month Some months is a little bit more, but yeah.
Andrew Daniels: I would kill for your bills. Mike. So huge and the kids never close the doors and they leave the shower running. Okay guys.
Wendy Barbe: Yeah. my kids.
Andrew Daniels: Come on. Okay, I'm glad it's not just me.
Wendy Barbe: Don't close the doors either ach Yeah. My kids are fuzzy and they think the back door should stand up on all hours of the day night and universe.
Andrew Daniels: They don't grow out of that eventually.
Wendy Barbe: Pepper is 14. He has yet to grow out of that. he teaches everybody that the door should stand wide open so he can come in and…
Andrew Daniels: That's my gosh. Yeah, all right.
Wendy Barbe: it will
Andrew Daniels: what do you do for Phone Internet.
Wendy Barbe: 
Wendy Barbe: Cable and phone together are 160. It's two separate bills,…
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Yeah,…
Wendy Barbe: but they're 160.
Andrew Daniels: do you have kind of a maintenance or improvement budget for the house?
Wendy Barbe: I really don't I should but I don't.
Andrew Daniels: What would you say, you spend on, what's your square footage of your house?
Wendy Barbe: 1,400 square feet.
Andrew Daniels: So is 1% per month? that seemed like 14 bucks a month? That's 170 dollars a year. If you just That doesn't. Yeah.
Wendy Barbe: That doesn't seem like enough to be quite honest. You have to do anything major. On the other hand, part of this loan was supposed to do some of that stuff. So, I yeah. But
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Why don't we Let's just start with 50 for now and that just put something in there.
Wendy Barbe: Yeah. 50. It makes more sense. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, do you pay for house cleaning?
Wendy Barbe: I don't mostly…
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Wendy Barbe: because I couldn't afford it, I probably ought to but we'll see. I'm a terrible housekeeper.
Andrew Daniels: That's okay. we only do it out literally to keep our sanity, we have a friend who is willing to do it for not $600 a…
00:30:00
Wendy Barbe: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Otherwise, that's what it would cost. And ideally she's a lifesaver…
Wendy Barbe: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: because our lives will be a disaster if we didn't have somebody to come in behind us.
Wendy Barbe: They're telling me I can actually get somebody in here. A couple of times a month for 60 bucks a month once I get it, cleared out. so,
Andrew Daniels: That's pretty cool. That's pretty good. What about food? your grocery budget?
Wendy Barbe: About. Okay, we're gonna be a little optimistic here. I'm going to use some discipline, but I think about 400 bucks a month.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, should we say 450 just in case? does that include eating out or restaurants?
Wendy Barbe: Okay, sounds good. I
Wendy Barbe: I don't do that. A whole lot, unless I'm on vacation. It's kind of risky gluten.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, yeah. We'll just Yeah. do you have a clothing or…
Wendy Barbe: Good good, there's a problem. Big
Andrew Daniels: personal care like by new clothes, or Coiler trees.
Wendy Barbe: I've never really put it in the budget.
Andrew Daniels: And Okay, we'll put 50 in 25 for each.
Wendy Barbe: The clothes come from goodwill, pretty much 99% of the time.
Wendy Barbe: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: And really this isn't to put you on a budget.
Andrew Daniels: I always get people like, I don't want to be committed with no,…
Wendy Barbe: No, no no, you need to know…
Andrew Daniels: not Right,…
Wendy Barbe: what you're actually spending. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: And, if you want to get in here and get detailed with this, that's totally fine. This is just gonna give us the look ahead. Do you have a health insurance premium
Wendy Barbe: It comes out. it's taking up before I see it. I'm not sure what it is.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, what is it like a hundred and twenty? Or is it more like 500? Okay, and…
Wendy Barbe: No, it's more like the hundred and twenty.
Andrew Daniels: get paid by weekly, So 120 times,…
Wendy Barbe: Right.
Andrew Daniels: 26 paychecks and a weekly pay schedule, divided by 12 months is 260 bucks a month on. That's how that averages out.
Wendy Barbe: And I can probably bring that down. By cutting back the insurance. I mean that's the higher end insurance.
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: I mean, I don't know. Yeah, and…
Wendy Barbe: But if you land in the hospital,…
Wendy Barbe: it's 10%.
Andrew Daniels: I don't know that.
Wendy Barbe: So I don't know.
Andrew Daniels: I don't know that. That's an area that we want to, cut back on if you have good insurance and it's only 260 bucks a month. I don't think that would be my first place to start cutting. yeah.
Wendy Barbe: Okay, sit on that one. That's what I'm going to have to make a decision about in the next two or…
Andrew Daniels: Right? And,…
Wendy Barbe: three months. So
Andrew Daniels: if you want me to help you with those numbers, I have additional calculators that we can go through that. We can say,…
Wendy Barbe: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Hey This is what this is. What makes the most sense? And why did I click out of that? I don't know why I clicked out of that. So here's another thing that we need to consider at age 65, you are going to go back to healthcare and insurance. Here we go at age 65 You'll be on Medicare, So you'll get on that three months before you're 65 so January of 2031.
Wendy Barbe: Right.
Andrew Daniels: We're gonna assume that We're just gonna say, Hey, whatever that health insurance is gonna stop. Now this numbers kind of iffy…
Wendy Barbe: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: because if you stop working at 62 then obviously it'll be a little bit sooner than 2031 for this.
Wendy Barbe: Right.
Andrew Daniels: We're gonna just assume that you keep having that good health insurance until 65
Wendy Barbe: Which is probably,…
Andrew Daniels: Actually, what's the earliest?
Wendy Barbe: which is probably more realistic. Anyway, let's be honest.
Andrew Daniels: Three months before your 65th birthday. Unless you're Social Security. So, for now, What? We don't know when you're gonna take Social Security. So, we're just gonna put a mental note. When we're going through your plan, if we optimize your Social Security and…
Wendy Barbe: Right.
Andrew Daniels: you take it at 62, then we need to change the numbers for when you're gonna take Medicare. Otherwise we'll make the Medicare numbers match with age 65. your Medicare Part B and…
Wendy Barbe: Right.
Andrew Daniels: D premiums. I'm just gonna put a number in here based on my experience. We're gonna say this is about 70 bucks and…
Wendy Barbe: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: we're gonna do an advantage plan for 50. Those won't start until 2031.
Andrew Daniels: So what we're doing here is we're gonna split these off so we can properly focus on the expenses that are really going to be there. Do you have any prescriptions How much per month based?
Wendy Barbe: Yeah.
Wendy Barbe: About a hundred bucks. Because they won't cover the thyroid medicine.
Andrew Daniels: Right. Okay, do you pay for any life insurance?
Wendy Barbe: That might be less than actually,…
Wendy Barbe: it's probably less than that. Okay.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, let's do 80. Life insurance. You pay for any life insurance outside of what work provides.
Wendy Barbe: Now I pay a little extra I signed up for the best thing I can get because I know I didn't have any money so I figured so it's like 240,000 on a term.
Andrew Daniels: And that's probably comes out of your check, right?
Wendy Barbe: That comes out of my check and I think it's less than 15 bucks. it's like 10 bucks,…
Andrew Daniels: Yes, it's gonna be like,…
Wendy Barbe: a paycheck.
Andrew Daniels: it's gonna be 12 dollars a paycheck or…
Wendy Barbe: Yeah, I was gonna say $25 a month.
00:35:00
Andrew Daniels: something. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah that sounds about right.
Wendy Barbe: Yeah. It's one of those things you can always cut it back,…
Wendy Barbe: but adding it back in, if you want to bump it back up, to the max is kind of difficult. So
Andrew Daniels: And we'll look at that because if you end up having a policy that more than covers that then that might be an expense, you don't need to have any longer and we can just transfer it.
Wendy Barbe: Right. Okay.
Andrew Daniels: Do you have any long-term care insurance that you pay for?
Wendy Barbe: I don't
Andrew Daniels: I'm assuming your work provides disability, but do you have a separate disability policy?
Wendy Barbe: I have 100% disability policy. Because they,…
Andrew Daniels: Okay, what's
Wendy Barbe: if you're shoot, if you're off more,…
Andrew Daniels: is that from your job? Okay.
Wendy Barbe: Because you can't save your vacation. You can only carry over 40 hours a year.
Andrew Daniels: Right.
Wendy Barbe: So for 10 bucks, a paycheck, you are 11 bucks. I think actually you're actually paying
Andrew Daniels: I was good. I started doing numbers on $9 a paycheck, it seems
Wendy Barbe: Yeah, yeah, it's somewhere in there. The first 60% I think is actually free. But if you want to bump it up to 100% it's like nine dollars a paychecks.
Andrew Daniels: okay. Yeah.
Wendy Barbe: So if anything happens to you after six weeks you can start getting your full paycheck.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. So We're gonna end both of these at 62 for now until we determine…
Wendy Barbe: We can write,…
Andrew Daniels: what Yeah.
Wendy Barbe: we can change that.
Andrew Daniels: But I'm letting you know this so that you can kind of understand my logic. if you're not working, if you retire from that job, we're not going to have these expenses anymore so we don't need to project them out it,…
Wendy Barbe: But we Right.
Andrew Daniels: inflation out…
Andrew Daniels: till you're 90.
Wendy Barbe: Right, although we may need to find other options to replace some of them.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Any car,…
Wendy Barbe: I know.
Andrew Daniels: any car loans? No, perfect. What is you?
Wendy Barbe: and as long and unlikely to ever have one quite honestly,…
Andrew Daniels: Good.
Andrew Daniels: What is your car insurance look like?
Wendy Barbe: I have a car dealer.
Wendy Barbe: A car insurance is through USAA, it's about 350 a month mostly…
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Wendy Barbe: because I keep having insults with Bambi and stuff.
Andrew Daniels: Do you have,…
Wendy Barbe: Maybe.
Andrew Daniels: what is your coverage that you have on that? Do you have full liability like the Max liability that you can have? Okay, what about the comprehensive and…
Wendy Barbe: Yeah, I do. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: collision is that?
Wendy Barbe: I have full comprehensive a collision plus a year, which is one reason…
Andrew Daniels: Okay..
Wendy Barbe: why it went up this year because it was like the last car I got, which actually looks like it's been through the wars and gets the best gas mileage I've ever seen in my life.
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Wendy Barbe: I drive a van, I'm getting almost 28 miles to the gallon on the stupid thing.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, yeah. You were telling me that you got good.
Wendy Barbe: and it looks like it's the War of the Roses but yeah, so I'm paying More for insurance because it's not 2005 or 2006 if they're gonna total at two grand.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, yeah. Okay.
Wendy Barbe: But it's one of those ones you walk into a rental car agency and you say, you're going to use their insurance and they're like, are you sure? And you, tell them who the insurance company is that? yeah, you're sure. It's yeah.
Andrew Daniels: What do you spend on fuel every month?
Wendy Barbe: About five, fifty, six hundred. And that's …
Andrew Daniels: 600.
Wendy Barbe: that's probably realistic some months not quite as much but Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: and then what I'm also gonna do is I'm gonna say,
Wendy Barbe: That's part of driving too far to go to work. It would be nice to knock that down to a couple hundred a month going to the Dog Club.
Andrew Daniels: yeah, I'm gonna say
Andrew Daniels: We're gonna end this by the time you're 85. I don't think you'll be spending money on cars after 85 much. there's a chance that you will, but we're gonna say,…
Wendy Barbe: It'll be something else like ubers and…
Wendy Barbe: stuff probably just to get to doctor.
Andrew Daniels: yeah, you're probably not gonna Yeah,…
Wendy Barbe: So that gets picked up by Medicaid. So,
Andrew Daniels: you're probably not going to be driving $600 of fuel every month,…
Wendy Barbe: No, absolutely not.
Andrew Daniels: eighty five.
Wendy Barbe: Yeah, no.
Andrew Daniels: So that's just one of those things. It's a small difference but not having that expense between 85 and…
Wendy Barbe: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: 98 is huge and most people don't do that after 85
Wendy Barbe: And that if I get to the point where I'm Working from home. Most of the time that's going to go down a couple hundred bucks a month instead of 600 a month.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. this could change three years from now and we could say 50 or 60% of that just from you changing…
Wendy Barbe: but,
Andrew Daniels: how you're working. So absolutely. I usually put 50 bucks a month on repairs just because I know it's hard to budget for it. But
Wendy Barbe: Yeah. No, at least That is the drawback of driving older cars,…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, good. that's in more maintenance.
Wendy Barbe: but yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, credit cards student loans, alimony and child support any of those.
Wendy Barbe: Credit cards.
Andrew Daniels: What's the payment that you're making on the credit cards? you have the total monthly
Wendy Barbe: Minimum is about $900 a month. Before I started trying to do this loan thing and…
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Wendy Barbe: they're trying to get me to fix up the house before they give me the low. I was paying almost $2,000 a month trying to get them down.
Andrew Daniels: And have you already paid the credit cards off? Okay.
Wendy Barbe: No. Not yet. I don't even have the money yet. The money doesn't come…
00:40:00
Andrew Daniels: Okay, okay.
Wendy Barbe: till tomorrow. And you had talked about other options. So, right now, I'm install mode except I'm gonna have to do something about the contractor pretty quick.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, so we'll optimize that next and then so none of these, No tuition alimony of shots.
Wendy Barbe: No, no.
Andrew Daniels: We're gonna just delete.
Wendy Barbe: Thank God for scholarships and lots of years.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, do you have a budget for parties and events? Hobbies and lessons memberships or vacation?
Wendy Barbe: Are you realistically? That's about a hundred bucks a month.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, for the vacation or just all of it. Okay, I'm just gonna put a hundred in here,…
Wendy Barbe: All of it. Yeah. Maybe that's too much,…
Andrew Daniels: any charity or gifts. That's okay.
Wendy Barbe: but I'd like to get back to that, but those are more spontaneous and if there's money in the bank account. So,
Andrew Daniels: Right, right? get used to having money in the bank account because I'm very excited.
Wendy Barbe: I'll worry about it when I get there,…
Wendy Barbe: how's that? Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yes you can.
Andrew Daniels: That's only mine anything for charity or gifts.
Wendy Barbe: To see five percent in there if I could. So what's that 300 bucks a month or…
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Wendy Barbe: That's what I'd love to have, but that's gonna predicate on getting a lot of other things,…
Andrew Daniels: That's not,…
Wendy Barbe: straightened out. So Yeah,…
Andrew Daniels: that's not current though. Okay. That's okay,…
Wendy Barbe: I know that's not current at all. …
Andrew Daniels: we can.
Wendy Barbe: We're pretty much limited to the gas station. I'd like to throw an extra buck on my purchase at the gas station kind of a thing.
Andrew Daniels: Write. Yeah.
Wendy Barbe: Which isn't? Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. that's good and we can make a plan, we can put that in the goals list that you'd like to have, five percent go towards Charity. And when we organize everything, we'll make sure that there's enough room for that and…
Wendy Barbe: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: what that looks like. what's the balance on the home mortgage?
Wendy Barbe: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Then that we just got
Wendy Barbe: 
Wendy Barbe: 85 5, something. Somewhere in that version.
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Wendy Barbe: I guess if
Wendy Barbe: Yeah, no. Yeah. They came down even the last day before they can't coming down last week. they started a hundred and they ended up at 85,000. I didn't even catch that that actually dropped the day they put in the paperwork.
Andrew Daniels: okay, so we'll just say,
Andrew Daniels: my Okay whatever. And what's the total balance of the credit card debt?
Wendy Barbe: 28,000.
Andrew Daniels: 28. Okay. And that's across several credit cards.
Wendy Barbe: That's three credit cards. Yeah, they're trying to get me to give them information so they can raise the balance I'm thinking.
Andrew Daniels: Three credit cards. Okay?
Wendy Barbe: Not bloody likely you.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, so we're gonna save that. Do you have any money that comes in regularly? That's outside of your 2 income? Or any expenses,…
Wendy Barbe: Know.
Andrew Daniels: major expenses that you have planned. all right, so this
Wendy Barbe: Okay, let me phrase that because we're trying to get the flooring done at the house after the water heater broke.
Andrew Daniels: okay. yeah.
Wendy Barbe: And eventually, I'm going to have to do the roof. The flooring is purchased. The contractor has to be paid.
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: Flooring, how much…
Wendy Barbe: And I owe him money at this…
Andrew Daniels: how much is that going to be?
Wendy Barbe: The flooring is purchased. I might owe Tom.
Andrew Daniels: but you have to pay the contractor. How much is he cost?
Wendy Barbe: the original thing he said was 9,000, but he's done a hell of a lot more than he was contracted to do, so I'm betting. It's gonna be closer to 12.
Andrew Daniels: I was, Yes. Should we do 12? yes,…
Wendy Barbe: Yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: I've done this too long. It's like we should probably add about 30%. Yeah.
Wendy Barbe: Yeah. Yeah, I didn't expect him to actually clean the entire house and reorganize everything while he was at it. Step kids are awesome.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah.
Wendy Barbe: People sometimes.
Andrew Daniels: So We've got a flooring payment for 12,000. We're gonna say right now, a non-taxable external source, even though we know it's coming from the home equity money or the mortgage money.
Wendy Barbe: Right. Right.
Andrew Daniels: We already have that 85,000 track somewhere else. So we're gonna keep tracked over in those liabilities and we're just gonna say, it's gonna go to pay expenses for now.
Wendy Barbe: Right.
Andrew Daniels: And in order to make this all match out, the next thing that we can do is we can go back to the expense plan. And we can say on maybe household, we can add an entry that just says, 2024 flooring updates. And we'll say that it's twelve thousand dollars in September of 24.
Wendy Barbe: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: Oops.
Wendy Barbe: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: So right there, what we did, if you recall is we're going to capture the fact that you're paying $12,000 on your expense plan. But we also told the software that you're going to have non-taxable money that you use to pay it.
Wendy Barbe: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: So we're just kind of closing the loop on everything.
Wendy Barbe: Right, so it's not looking for income coming out of my paycheck to do it.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, that keeps everything kind of settled but then we're able to track that you paid for the floor.
Wendy Barbe: Yep.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, so on this I don't think you will see the Cash Flows tab on the client side. But at the agents we can see this and we can run these reports. And so this is really cool because what this software does now that we have all the basic data built out is You can see month by month year by year. Exactly, what is going where here's the income coming in.
00:45:00
Wendy Barbe: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: What's going into your 401k here is where we spend the flooring. Here's your gross income. Here's any before, salary deductions taxes, withheld, yada and it's all in there. So, this is basically your projection on your paycheck,
Wendy Barbe: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: every Month. We've got expenses and you can see the expenses kind of get slightly larger each month. So what it's doing is it's annualizing out that inflation rate to make sure that it's covered. Now it's not going to be locked up with what actually happens but that's why it's so important to me that I meet with somebody…
Wendy Barbe: Yeah. who can predict?
Andrew Daniels: but Yeah.
Wendy Barbe: Yeah. Who could predict the last year or…
Andrew Daniels: Right. …
Wendy Barbe: two years?
Andrew Daniels: yeah, exactly.
Andrew Daniels: And at the end of the year or at the end of the next 12 months, when we go through this, maybe you haven't actually spent this amount of money, you didn't need to do any, car repairs or anything, that extra money. We're gonna start to shuffle around and put it where you can never lose it again,…
Wendy Barbe: Four years.
Wendy Barbe: Right. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: right?,
Andrew Daniels: And then this is shows us and this accounts to pay expenses. This is for more in retirement because it's going to have these overflow accounts where as you're generating extra money, it throws them in there. and now it's showing us that there's a gap, right?
Wendy Barbe: Yeah.
Wendy Barbe: Okay, this is what you're projecting. I'm gonna be short that much.
Andrew Daniels: Let's take This is a better look. If we go to the top six to the Pre Retirement tab, That will tell us exactly…
Wendy Barbe: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: what we need and I'm gonna let it calculate for a second. There we go. calculating.
Wendy Barbe: Right, I'm toast So, we have to do some work.
Andrew Daniels: So there's work. What we're looking for on this particular piece. yeah, so we have a net monthly cash flow that's negative. that's a problem.
Wendy Barbe: Right.
Andrew Daniels: Especially in Pre-retirement, you can see that this spendable assets,…
Wendy Barbe: Right. Wait a…
Andrew Daniels: So it's
Wendy Barbe: So you're saying I'm spending more now than or…
Andrew Daniels: Right based,…
Wendy Barbe: what I budgeted in as Okay.
Andrew Daniels: what we just went through. Yeah. …
Wendy Barbe: All…
Andrew Daniels: let's double.
Wendy Barbe: Which is…
Andrew Daniels: Let's This.
Wendy Barbe: why I keep running into credit card debt. I'm spending too much.
Andrew Daniels: Yes, right and this is okay because once we identify the problem, now we can know what to tackle. So let me just double check that I didn't do anything weird on the Expenses.
Wendy Barbe: Right.
Andrew Daniels: 24. That's fine.
Wendy Barbe: So, did we?
Andrew Daniels: I just want to make sure
Wendy Barbe: Wait a minute. I did is the credit card stuff in here. Is that written in?
Andrew Daniels: Let's We did the credit card payments and we did the balance.
Wendy Barbe: All right. If that's in there. that's probably why we have such a huge discrepancy at the moment…
Andrew Daniels: Yes.
Wendy Barbe: because I'm planning to take that loan and do something with. I was…
Andrew Daniels: Yes, right.
Wendy Barbe: I thought once I got rid of those credit card bills, this would actually settle down a little bit. Okay, that makes a lot of sense right there.
Andrew Daniels: I think Yeah it will we haven't really done that because I just wanted to see what would happen as is right now before they're paid off health insurance.
Wendy Barbe: Okay. All right.
Andrew Daniels: That. Yeah. do you have vet bills? What would you?
Wendy Barbe: Yeah, poop. 150 a month.
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Wendy Barbe: Just because in Ohio, if you don't give your dog heartworm, you'll have dead dogs. It's just pretty much I guarantee. It's endemic.
Wendy Barbe: That lose you. What did you do? Everybody just froze up, Andy.
Wendy Barbe: Poof.
Wendy Barbe: Poof.
Wendy Barbe: Poof poof. Hey.

00:00:00
 
Cheri M.: Hello.
Andrew Daniels: Hey, how are you
Cheri M.: How are
Andrew Daniels: doing?
Cheri M.: you? Good. How are you?
Andrew Daniels: Fantastic. Getting like cut off on my camera here. Awesome. Okay. Hi. How are you? All right. So, we're all connected here. You guys got the conference room.
Cheri M.: Yeah, we're having lunch, so don't mind us.
Andrew Daniels: No worries. Oh, yeah. No worries. That's That's totally fine. Um Well, awesome. So, I heard you guys had a break uh just last what was that last week or the week before?
Cheri M.: Last week.
Andrew Daniels: Oh, that's got to be nice. Good time for it, too. Early in the summer.
Cheri M.: Yep.
Andrew Daniels: That is great. That's great. Well, very good. Well, thanks for uh setting this up today. Sorry it's taking so long. this one. Uh, I wanted to make sure we did things kind of step by step just to make sure we don't have any weird things that happen, you know.
 
 
00:03:53
 
Andrew Daniels: So, I think we got the the home path all squared away. And, um, I believe you should have already gotten at least one the first month's uh, deposit in there. Have you been able to get logged in on your online account for for directed IRA?
Cheri M.: Yes, I've checked it and and you are correct. I have gotten the first deposit.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, awesome. Yeah. Well, they'll just keep doing that. A lot of times they pay early which we love.
Cheri M.: Could you write a check for real quick. Yes. Hold on. Hold on one second.
Andrew Daniels: Sure thing.
Cheri M.: Sorry. Uh for that amount. Okay. To this KN&N services. I can do that. Just print it and I can give it to them. All right. No. I got to I'm looking for my phone clearly right here. No, for real. You clock it in. Clocked in a little earlier. Cuz what if you had left?
 
 
00:05:17
 
Cheri M.: Oh. Sorry, one more work duty to do.
Andrew Daniels: Oh, no worries. Yeah, it's fine.
Cheri M.: Perfect. Description. That hurts. Okay. All right, I'm good. All right, we're good. I think he's good.
Andrew Daniels: worries. No worries. Um, okay, perfect. So, I just want to run through real quick and make sure that all of our all of our numbers are up to date. Sherry and I did a little uh little bit of pre-work on um on how we're going to design this. Um, now, one thing I do have to say is the report that I sent you is pretty much we're we're considering that all but like completely uh outdated, I guess, is the right word to say.
Cheri M.: Okay. That very first report a long time ago.
Andrew Daniels: Correct. Yes.
Cheri M.: All
Andrew Daniels: And
Cheri M.: right.
Andrew Daniels: the reason for that is because we're not proceeding with the full investment of the IRA. We're only doing 29,000.
 
 
00:09:03
 
Andrew Daniels: That
Cheri M.: Correct.
Andrew Daniels: drastically changes the number. So, I'm only going to I'm only going to illustrate what we know to be true. And that is you have a $29,000 note that's going to kick off 8% every year. We're going to build our game plan on that because I like the foundation to be on solid ground. I don't know what's going to happen in the market, but whenever you're ready, you can tell me what you'd like to do with that or keep doing it with wherever, right? And that's we'll just go with what we have and worst case scenario, anything we get beyond that is extra. So,
Cheri M.: Got
Andrew Daniels: I
Cheri M.: it.
Andrew Daniels: like to I like to plan for the worst and hope for the best.
Cheri M.: Got it.
Andrew Daniels: Um, so on I just wanted to run through some of these real quick. So, we went through and we did your uh on an earlier call, we had put in some expenses, and I just want to make sure that these are still correct.
 
 
00:09:53
 
Andrew Daniels: Mortgage at 275. Um homeowners insurance and taxes are about $140 a piece. That makes your total mortgage payment around $550. Is that accurate?
Cheri M.: that's actually went up due to in I guess because homeowners insurance evidently went up.
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Cheri M.: I didn't get a notice from the insurance company, but I just got a notice from um the bank. The house payment right now is right at 700.
Andrew Daniels: 700. Okay.
Cheri M.: 700. Yes.
Andrew Daniels: All right. That's an additional $149. Okay. And this is why I always check, especially if it takes a little bit of time, is because I understand things change. So, we want to make sure we accurately capture that. Um, utilities, gas, electric, uh, water, sewer, still around $300 a month.
Cheri M.: Yes, pretty much. Yes.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Cable, phone, and internet, 300.
Cheri M.: Yes.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Um, groceries, which you're including, uh, kind of clothing and personal care. We've got that targeted at $450 a month.
 
 
00:11:04
 
Cheri M.: We're close to that. Yes.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. And then an additional 200 for dining out.
Cheri M.: Yes.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Um let's see. We've got the Medicare BND164 and $15 from healthcare.gov. Uh nothing for prescriptions, long-term care, disability, or anything like that.
Cheri M.: Um the healthc care has changed.
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Cheri M.: My insurance went up. I think it's 122 because it's based on my through healthcare.gov. It's based on income and because I
Andrew Daniels: Right.
Cheri M.: worked more last year it went up. Not that
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Cheri M.: I raise I just work more.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Cheri M.: I need a
Andrew Daniels: So,
Cheri M.: raise.
Andrew Daniels: so instead of instead of $15 per month, it's now $122 per month. And
Cheri M.: Yes. If I'm not mistaken, that's the correct price.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. And then we also still have the Medicare B and D premiums at 164.
Cheri M.: That's correct.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Okay. The uh truck loan is at 671.
 
 
00:12:16
 
Cheri M.: Yes.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Um insurance $300 per month. Fuel $500 per month.
Cheri M.: Can we Hello.
Andrew Daniels: No, no, sorry. Uh, auto
Cheri M.: I'm sorry.
Andrew Daniels: insurance, $300 a month. Still, uh, still sound like what it is?
Cheri M.: Yes.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Uh, let's see. Now, we've got credit cards tracked at about $300 a month for the minimum payments. But when I look at the numbers that we broke down, we had a almost one that was at 10,000, one that was at 3500, and one that was at 600. Did the $600 one get paid off?
Cheri M.: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, perfect. That's great. So, we'll take that out. And then, um, balances and and payments for the $10,000 credit card payment is about $200 a month.
Cheri M.: Correct.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. And the 3500 payments at about $60 a month.
Cheri M.: Correct.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. All right. That's good there. Okay. So, we'll take 260. Uh, let's see.
 
 
00:13:24
 
Andrew Daniels: We've got $250 a month budgeted for charity, church and charity, I guess we could say. Uh gifts at 50. Um okay. So I just I always like to make sure that our expected outflow is what like is current. So, um, when we when we check in on you, we'll check in every six months, um, because stuff happens and we want to make sure that all of this all of this stays up to date because that helps us adjust the game plan, you know, going forward. It it's not necessary to look at the numbers every day or even every month, but just about every six months seems to be good enough of a pace where we can make adjustments as things happen.
Cheri M.: Gotcha.
Andrew Daniels: Um, so the reason we're meeting today is to talk about this insurance policy and how it can help you um how we can get some efficiency in your game plan. So
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: when you think about the insurance policy and we just went through your budget, what amount do you think you could put towards the policy?
 
 
00:14:28
 
Cheri M.: I don't know.
Andrew Daniels: That's a loaded that's a loaded question, but part of it is I want to understand I want to gauge your perception of your finances so that I can help untangle it for you. So, I want to know what you think about where you're at right now.
Cheri M.: I mean, that's what, you know, that's a hard question because where I think I'm at right now is paycheck to paycheck. In all honesty,
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah.
Cheri M.: I mean, I'm a poor girl and that's why I'm talking to you because I want you to get me on Twitter.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. No, no, no. That's that's totally fine. And I see I do see some So, we are we're we're real close. We're right on the line. But I think if we skillfully apply some of the strategies, you're doing a good thing by getting the 29,000 going. We're going to get somebody else to add money to your system. And then if we organized it correctly, our our primary goal is to stop the cycle of debt.
 
 
00:15:27
 
Andrew Daniels: So the reason when I see $10,000 credit card, $ 3500, I'm assuming you guys aren't just going out buying bond bonds. Something happened. You had to get all four new tires on the car replaced all at once and it was $1,700. Those kinds of things. If we can stop that cycle, you'll be surprised how much quicker you can get ahead, right?
Cheri M.: All
Andrew Daniels: And
Cheri M.: Right.
Andrew Daniels: so that's part of what we're going to do with the policies that we with the policies that we're putting together. There's a really unique feature that I think is going to help solve this for you. Um, and it may not be that you understand it completely upfront, but what I find is as we work with people and they start to use it that it becomes clear as they see it start to work. Um,
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: what happens is we'll be able to run I want you to think of the life insurance policy as your warehouse of wealth.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: Now, it's all well and good to have the warehouse.
 
 
00:16:27
 
Andrew Daniels: Even better that when you put money into the warehouse, they track that and they will credit dividends based on the total amount of money that you've put into the warehouse, regardless of whether you turn around and take that money right back out of the warehouse.
Cheri M.: question.
Andrew Daniels: Yes.
Cheri M.: Um, depending on how much I put in the warehouse, how much how much is added to what I put in?
Andrew Daniels: Um there. So the way that the way that that will depend on how we construct the policy. My goal will be to get it as close as possible that what you put in can come out. Now, there is a base amount that we're going to have to calculate and the total amount that you're allowed to put in depends on the original base amount that we set. So, it's a little bit like um have you ever played one of those games where you've got like maybe a grid of dots and some of them are colored red, some of them are colored blue. You flip over one of the blue dots to red and it changes two or three of the other dots from whatever they are to the other one.
 
 
00:17:40
 
Andrew Daniels: That's a little bit how this is. It's a little bit of a puzzle. Um, my goal will be here's here's how I'm going to set this up. First off, I want the the baseline to be as low as we possibly can get it. Whatever is going to keep the policy inside of the IRS guidelines to keep it non-t taxable
Cheri M.: All right.
Andrew Daniels: and whatever that minimum amount is, I want it to be high enough that you have an option to put more in, but not an obligation.
Cheri M.: Gotcha.
Andrew Daniels: And the reason I do that is because there will be in the next five years that we're executing this game plan there. Well, I can't say there will be. There might be a time when you say, "Oh, something's happened. We can't do that much every month right now." And I'll say, "No big deal. Let's cut that down to the bare minimum." And we may cut it in half. And
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: that's going to be enough breathing room to get through whatever happens that we got to get through.
 
 
00:18:38
 
Andrew Daniels: And then when that's done, you can raise it back up. And I I like the there's a bare minimum. There's kind of a midpoint that we'll set the monthly that hey, everything's going fine right now. We set that monthly amount. And then there's going to be a maximum where as we generate extra money in your system. We're going to we're going to pre-plan a spot for the extra money to go because I'm planning on having you have extra money. That's what people get when they work with me is more than they know what to do with. So, I pre-plan the extra spot where we can make it non-t taxable, too. So,
Cheri M.: Did
Andrew Daniels: we
Cheri M.: you see the work
Andrew Daniels: have
Cheri M.: I
Andrew Daniels: these.
Cheri M.: just gave you?
Andrew Daniels: Do what?
Cheri M.: I said, "Did you see the look I just gave you when you
Andrew Daniels: Oh,
Cheri M.: said more than I know what to do?"
Andrew Daniels: yeah. Yeah. You'd be surprised.
 
 
00:19:23
 
Andrew Daniels: You'd be surprised.
Cheri M.: You
Andrew Daniels: Um
Cheri M.: know, seeing is well, receiving is believing.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah. Um, so at least for this first year, we've got a little bit about a hundred or $200 a month worth of surplus. Now, when I run the projection, I can see month by month and year by year, I can see whether or not you're bringing in enough money to cover your uh your expenses. And if I go through the years, one of the things you'll notice that happens is your net monthly expenses slightly increase.
Cheri M.: Right.
Andrew Daniels: And the reason for that is because we're not going to be we're not going to plan in a vacuum like the economic environment means that inflation is happening. It's going to happen no matter what. So, we need to make a plan that you've got to have some sort of level of increase on that. Um, and that that will come and I think we'll we'll adjust those expenses. I it's common these days for insurance rates to go up, for taxes to go up, but I've also had it go back down, too.
 
 
00:20:29
 
Andrew Daniels: I've also had things come off the expenses that, you know, we thought maybe they were just going to be there forever. So, that's why we do that six month six month review is to make sure that all that stuff stays up to date. Now, when we build the policy and you're running money through it, there are a couple of things that you can do. And
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: one of the one of the priorities that I think we would tackle is some of this credit card debt. You're going to be able to take and and you will have to tell me what you're comfortable with and how you want to administrate this. Um, but there is a possibility if you really want to tackle this debt, we can get it cleared out quickly. And the way you would do that is instead of simply paying $200 a month to the credit card company directly, you run that $200 through your policy, take it back out, and pay down the uh and make the credit card payment.
Cheri M.: Okay, I got a question right there.
 
 
00:21:31
 
Andrew Daniels: Yes. Go ahead.
Cheri M.: What's the purpose of putting the 200 to the policy and taking it right back out?
Andrew Daniels: Because when you when you put it in there and you put it through that gate, that gate closes and it credits $200 as dividend eligible, like dividend paying eligible $200. So from there on out, for the rest of your life, you get paid a dividend every year they issue one. And they've not issued one or they've issued one every year for 125 years. So, you'll get $200 that has compounding interest working for you even though you take the $200 and you pay the credit card company with it.
Cheri M.: And how much is the dividend?
Andrew Daniels: Uh, it could be anywhere from I think right now the dividend crediting rate is 5.2%. And there I'm going to put a little asterisk there because a lot of people will try to do a calculation of just dividing by the number of the dividend. Doesn't quite work that way. But let's just say it's 5%.
Cheri M.: Okay,
 
 
00:22:31
 
Andrew Daniels: Just to keep it simple, and I trust that I I have mechanics that I can explain later, but to keep it simple, it's 5%.
Cheri M.: gotcha.
Andrew Daniels: So, $200 a month at 5% growing that up over a oh, I don't know, let's say a fiveyear period. Um, and let me see here. I can just do that. Run that real quick. So, you put away you put in $200 a month and you get out, say that credit's at 5%. That $200 a month turns into an additional $13,000
Cheri M.: Over what period?
Andrew Daniels: five years. Now, we're going to take off we're going to what? Since we're taking it right back out, we
Cheri M.: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: need to take off we need to take out the the money the $200 that we or the the payments on the credit cards, right? The $9.99 and the 3500. Right now, it doesn't seem like much
Cheri M.: All
Andrew Daniels: in the beginning, but what's going to happen is your policy as it gets older, the amount of money that you're able to pull out per money put in increases.
 
 
00:23:46
 
Andrew Daniels: So, I don't because I haven't I haven't technically constructed your policy yet. I've got a couple of pieces that I think are probably where we're going to start.
Cheri M.: right.
Andrew Daniels: Um, it may be the first year it might be 60 to 70%. The next year it might be 80%, by the third year it might be 90. By the fourth year it's 100. Let's just say by the fifth year it's 100%. And you're able to take back out every dime that you put in. But the trend doesn't stop there. By year seven, it's 103%. By year 10, it's 115%. by 15 years in it's 122%. So even though like basically what we're doing is when we set you up with this at age 74 you're going to have a guaranteed spot that you can put in let's just say $5,000 that year and get back out $8,000.
Cheri M.: Gotcha.
Andrew Daniels: Now Sherry, we went through these numbers. Do you have additional context to add for Melissa on that? cuz you saw how I did those calculations.
 
 
00:24:54
 
Cheri M.: Yes. Um yes, there was a certain point where um like she would break even and then she would like get more than she put in, right? And then like at age I forgot what age it was like she gets like would get like a whole bunch
Andrew Daniels: Yes.
Cheri M.: compared
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Cheri M.: to
Andrew Daniels: We were getting up to like 150% of what you put in. And and I think the goal there is as we build this obviously one of our one of our primary concerns is to make sure that this works with your cash flow now and that the net impact it shouldn't feel like any extra out-of pocket cost to you right when we put this together you shouldn't be paying your insurance premium and going oh my gosh there's no money left to buy bread and milk right that's not the goal we're going to find we're going to find areas of inefficiency that we can then start to claw back and instead of having money leave your life to go to everybody else, we're going to turn a portion of it back and just basically take it from your always taxable left pocket to put it back into your never taxable right pocket.
 
 
00:26:01
 
Andrew Daniels: And where this loop closes is at some point in retirement as you build up those policy values, we'll be able to take those in lump sums and turn them into additional streams of income over the next 10 or 15 years.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: That's the long-term goal. I don't even have any of that illustrated right yet. Right. Because we're just talking about getting the seed planted.
Cheri M.: So my question right now is I do understand what you're saying about putting in and taking back out,
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Cheri M.: but my question is once you put it in, how long do you have to leave it in before you can pull it back out? Especially if you're at a point right now where, like I told you, paycheck to paycheck. Um, so if I was to obligate to a certain amount of putting in, how long does it have to stay in before I'm able to take it back out to use it toward
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Cheri M.: the monthly bills?
Andrew Daniels: How long does it take a check to clear the bank?
 
 
00:27:01
 
Andrew Daniels: Three days. Five days.
Cheri M.: Depends. Depends.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. So, five day. Let's just say five days.
Cheri M.: Correct.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah, as long as they soon as it we can do it as quickly as they can verify that the funds have left your bank and actually been received by the company.
Cheri M.: Okay. All right.
Andrew Daniels: So, uh to give you to give you an example, I had a I had a woman who graduated from veterinary school. She went to school in like the Bahamas or Puerto Rico, some island, and she graduated at 27 years old with $500,000 of student loan debt. Her payments were $3,200 a month.
Cheri M.: Good lord.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, she was beside herself. She was working three veterinary jobs to afford it. And um what we did was we set up a uh we set up a premium that was $3,200 a month. And instead of just paying the student loans directly, we paid it through the policy, took the money right back out and applied those towards our student loan payments.
 
 
00:28:00
 
Andrew Daniels: So student loan company didn't know any different, right?
Cheri M.: All right. Uhoh. Hello. Something happened. Hello. That was weird. Swipe. I think his internet might be service. Hello. He's probably still talking. I know. Right at the bad part. Hello. Can you text me? I might. Yeah, I'm about to text them. We lost you. I know. You probably still yapping.
Andrew Daniels: Whoops.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: Sorry. I guess I got kicked out. I
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: don't know what happened. My
Cheri M.: Like
Andrew Daniels: internet
Cheri M.: no
Andrew Daniels: just
Cheri M.: more.
Andrew Daniels: said you're not
Cheri M.: All right. Sorry. Yeah. I just text
Andrew Daniels: Sorry.
Cheri M.: I'm like we lost you. Okay. Um you were at the 3200.
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Cheri M.: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. So over over a 9-year period, she made the $3,200 into her policy, took it right back out, put it into the student loans, and we started eventually two or three years in, there was more money available than just the $3,200 a month.
 
 
00:29:53
 
Andrew Daniels: There started to be she would put in $3,200 and then there would be $3,400 available for her to take back out. So we started taking the
Cheri M.: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: extra out and putting it all towards the student loans. The student loans were paid off in nine years. Now, here's the big qualification. She was left with a $500,000 outstanding to the life insurance company. But in her case, that wasn't a big deal because she was only 36. Between 36 and 66, you can fill up a $500,000 bucket in 30 years if nobody's dragging uh money out of you through interest. Now, your situation is slightly different because we don't have 30 years to pay it all back. But the other the other trick is,
Cheri M.: way I feel right now. I might not have
Andrew Daniels: right?
Cheri M.: five. I'm
Andrew Daniels: No,
Cheri M.: joking.
Andrew Daniels: no, no. Stay healthy. Um, the other thing is, do we need to worry about paying it back to the to the policy?
 
 
00:30:50
 
Andrew Daniels: I don't we don't necessarily need to worry about that. If you refinance your $10,000 and $3,500 uh credit cards through your policy, that's only $135,000. Over the next 30 years, your policy will grow by way more than that. Your death benefit is way more than that. So, if you get to be 89 and that 13,000 is still outstanding, they'll just take it off of your $90,000 death benefit and your beneficiaries will get $77,000.
Cheri M.: Gotcha.
Andrew Daniels: So, we
Cheri M.: All
Andrew Daniels: can leverage the fact that nobody knows when you're going to die, but we do know that you will, right? So will I, and so will all of us, right? Yeah. Yeah.
Cheri M.: right.
Andrew Daniels: And so you're going to take advantage of that by transferring the risk of dying too soon, but by by getting in this little narrow wedge where you're able to have access to those funds. And we're going to manipulate who owns the debt. Right now, the banks own $14,000 of your life, and we want you and Charlie to own it.
 
 
00:32:06
 
Andrew Daniels: So, if you guys decide you want to put $14,000 back to your 90year-old selves, you can do that on your schedule on a cash flow that doesn't, you know, it's not $200 a month. You might say, "Hey, let's put $10 a month back for our future selves." You will have complete control at that point over how and when and where even to do nothing.
Cheri M.: Okay. Okay. This is my
Andrew Daniels: Yes.
Cheri M.: question. I know you said you had a spreadsheet and all this um and you said you had an idea as far as what you thought at this point I could or could
Andrew Daniels: Uh
Cheri M.: not do and see my mind is already thinking something and I'm I'm also thinking
Andrew Daniels: yeah.
Cheri M.: forward because I know what we use the credit cards
Andrew Daniels: Uh
Cheri M.: for and I know each month what because this is the way Charlie and I do things. He has his and I'm not saying his. We have
Andrew Daniels: yeah.
Cheri M.: hours, but we keep things separate.
 
 
00:33:03
 
Cheri M.: Not that we don't know what each other does and not that we don't have access to what each
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Cheri M.: other does, but like he will write me a check each month for bills, which goes to the credit card because we use the credit card because we earn cash
Andrew Daniels: Mhm.
Cheri M.: on it
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Cheri M.: at the end of the year, which is not very much. But right now when you're po when you're poor, you know, if you get a a $500 $500 check at the end of the year, the beginning of the following year and and see right now my thought process is a certain amount, but if I see and understand what you're saying and I see it benefit from that, that check that he writes me for the credit card, which is a decent size amount for our bills, I can route that in there if I can pull it back out because then it's gonna make more.
Andrew Daniels: Now you're
Cheri M.: But
Andrew Daniels: thinking that is exactly the right line of thought.
 
 
00:33:58
 
Cheri M.: hey, look, hey, look, my mind thinks when it comes to money, but in saying that, I don't want to start there. I don't want to start there because I don't
Andrew Daniels: Yes.
Cheri M.: know.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Cheri M.: I'm not certain. I don't know you. And not saying that you're going to do anything. I I have Sherry here and I'm a taller. I know where she works and I know where she lives. I have her address,
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah.
Cheri M.: right? I can take her child hostage.
Andrew Daniels: Hey, you come to my
Cheri M.: She
Andrew Daniels: house
Cheri M.: does
Andrew Daniels: and
Cheri M.: love
Andrew Daniels: take all
Cheri M.: me.
Andrew Daniels: my children hostage. Please. Please.
Cheri M.: Right. You got five.
Andrew Daniels: I'll pay you to do it.
Cheri M.: Hey, I love Hey, I I do love kids, but I'm I can't afford five of them.
Andrew Daniels: Who can? I wish somebody would have warned me.
 
 
00:34:43
 
Cheri M.: But yes, if you, you know, kind of show me something where to start because like I said, my mind's already thinking from what I know is given to me to pay that each
Andrew Daniels: Right.
Cheri M.: month. And if I can route it in that to make money,
Andrew Daniels: Mhm.
Cheri M.: I don't have a problem with that. But I have to start and see for a few months that, hey, this okay, what he told me is working. I can see it. I can
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Cheri M.: believe it. So then maybe after I'm gonna say three to four months and maybe even and I don't want to say six months because to me that's but if I can see in three months I might can say oh okay Charlie's writing me a $1,000 check plus I can do this $200 I can write that $1,000 check in there and bam
Andrew Daniels: And it it
Cheri M.: get
Andrew Daniels: may
Cheri M.: it
Andrew Daniels: not
Cheri M.: Ah,
Andrew Daniels: it may not be possible to do that.
 
 
00:35:36
 
Andrew Daniels: It might not even be possible to do that much. Um the the pushpull that we have to recognize is if we know upfront that we're going to run it through and take it back out. Um then the base policy which is that bare minimum I don't want to expand that base policy too much because it's costly and it takes a while
Cheri M.: I
Andrew Daniels: for that part of it to accumulate cash. So my goal is
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: to keep the base as small as possible. Now, here's um here's one thing that I did consider. The money that's coming from HomePath and currently is getting deposited into your directed IRA. It's just going to it's just going to sit in that cash account and it will accumulate to the tune of $193 a month.
Cheri M.: Gotcha.
Andrew Daniels: We I we should leave a little bit in there for
Cheri M.: All
Andrew Daniels: fees, but I would feel comfortable saying $175 a month should be your base. And then whatever that gets us, whatever amount of over that gets us could be upwards of $500 or $600 additional, right?
 
 
00:36:47
 
Andrew Daniels: That would be your leeway to run money in and out.
Cheri M.: right, you lost me.
Andrew Daniels: Well, basically what I'm saying is because we know that Home Path's going to pay every month, that can be your foundational piece. And maybe you want to add to that. Maybe you go, "Okay, I could I could see myself putting in $25 a month as my savings, as my this is what I should be doing to just put away money for safe storage anyways." Great. So, but either way, HomePath is going to pay you every month. We know that money is going to be there. So, if we target the base as what we know is going to be there, that can be the foundation. And the reason that calculation is important is because they won't allow you to just put in like they did. doctors in the 80s were putting in $100,000 of cash for $5,000 of death benefit. And the IRS was like, "That's not a real life insurance policy. You can't do that.
 
 
00:37:41
 
Andrew Daniels: That's a tax shelter, right?" So, they limit us. And you have to have a certain size base that will then support all of the rest of the the money that you're trying to put in to get cash back out. So, I don't want to unnecessarily expand the base because that base piece can take five to seven years to start growing the cash. But that's a really critical piece because that's where you start to get more money back than what you put in. So it is
Cheri M.: I'm
Andrew Daniels: it
Cheri M.: sorry.
Andrew Daniels: is this little push and pull. Now, here's the other thing. I can absolutely appreciate you saying, "Well, I want to see how it works." Um the problem and the challenge, if I were even going to try to make that that work, is once we set the policy, the insurance company cannot change it for any reason. you can go request changes to it as the client, but when they say this is what we expect as the base, this is what we'll pay out as the death benefit, we we basically cast those in concrete.
 
 
00:38:43
 
Andrew Daniels: Three, four, five months down the road, if we want to adjust those, there are some limitations on what we can adjust. We won't be able to adjust the base policy at all. Um, and so we kind of have to be like, you know, I would air on the side of caution, right? If you're if you have any kind of trepidation or anxiety or you want to see how this works, my suggestion would be take the base of just what you know absolutely will be there. Home path pays every month. We know that that base is going to be there. If you did nothing else, that money could come from directed IRA to your bank account straight to the policy and you wouldn't be obligated for any additional money to do something where we're going to say, "Okay, we're going to set it one way, but then three months later we want the option to put in potentially $1,000 a month." That's too big of a spread for me to try to calculate. It would either be too costly
 
 
00:39:38
 
Cheri M.: Thank you.
Andrew Daniels: upfront because you might not do it and I would want you to get more cash benefits than just retaining the option or if we do it and then later you want to change it there's additional underwriting there's another paramed and they could still say no we don't want to change it. Does that make sense?
Cheri M.: It it does, but basically you're telling me directed IRA and home path are intertwined.
Andrew Daniels: They are because directed IRA is like a Tupperware container. Home path is the food you put in the container.
Cheri M.: Gotcha.
Andrew Daniels: So you can put all different kinds of food into the container. We just chose a secured note to put into that container.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: And
Cheri M.: And she can pull from that right now or right or at 59 I have
Andrew Daniels: note
Cheri M.: she can't
Andrew Daniels: you
Cheri M.: right
Andrew Daniels: can pull from
Cheri M.: or
Andrew Daniels: it right
Cheri M.: no.
Andrew Daniels: now. And based on the numbers, it's here's here's what Sherry and I talked about.
 
 
00:40:30
 
Andrew Daniels: You are so close to 59 and a half that when you pull from that direct IRA, yes, it will create taxable liability on the back end, but just like the thousand, that's not going to be something that we can't deal with out of the policy. Like, we will have money to pay the taxes on that. If you're earning 8%
Cheri M.: Right.
Andrew Daniels: and you get taxed 20% of 8%, okay, your actual yield is 7.4%. 4% you're still positive.
Cheri M.: Right.
Andrew Daniels: So, um, that would be how I would think we could structure this. And I've done this with people in Exactly. You're actually I've done this with somebody who was in a far worse off position than you were. So, I know that this is this is the way to do it. Um, because we have that foundational piece, we we already set up a piece of income for you to have. Now, we go make that piece of income double efficient, and you're going to get earnings on that 29,000.
 
 
00:41:26
 
Andrew Daniels: We'll take the 175, put it into your warehouse, let that start going. The extra money in your in your game plan, and I say extra because there is a little bit of extra, and some of that is, and if you guys can see my screen share, I'll show you. like
Cheri M.: You know that's
Andrew Daniels: this maintenance and improvement for your house. You guys spend money on your house and but I don't think you take $50 every month and spend $50 on your house every month. You got to get the
Cheri M.: right
Andrew Daniels: you
Cheri M.: Right.
Andrew Daniels: got to get the air conditioner maintained and it's $300. Okay. Well, that's six months of $50. So instead of letting that $50 build up in your checking account where the bank is not giving you any earnings on it, they're just saying, "Yeah, you can park your money here and we'll lend it out when you're not using it." Right? That $50 should be allocated towards your policy with the idea that when you need $300 from your policy, it's coming from what you're putting back.
 
 
00:42:29
 
Andrew Daniels: So there's $50 right there. Um, there was another line item that I saw. Repairs on the vehicles. There's another $50. When you guys need new tires, oil change, windshield wipers, whatever. If it's a large enough expense that you go, "Hey, I don't want this to come out of my cash flow this week, take it from your policy." And those kinds of things are how we stop the creep of the debt. Now, over time, because we're funding the policy with all these dividend paying eligible pieces, that $50 a month becomes more than $50 a month of value, which is where we start to attack this debt.
Cheri M.: Now, how easy is it to get money out
Andrew Daniels: Oh,
Cheri M.: of there?
Andrew Daniels: they EFT it to your bank account. And you can go online and just type in, I want $300. Send it to the bank account on file.
Cheri M.: And I can do that through on directed
Andrew Daniels: Uh,
Cheri M.: IRA.
Andrew Daniels: no. So, the the the parties the parties that we have involved, we have your IRA and they are a custodian and so they have to follow IRS rules for how money is is put in, taken out, all that stuff.
 
 
00:43:41
 
Andrew Daniels: Inside of
Cheri M.: Gotcha.
Andrew Daniels: directed IRA, you have a home path investment. You could have easily had gold, fine art, Apple stock, right? doesn't matter what it is, but everything that's inside of that container has to stay in that container in order to maintain its tax status. It's only when you take it out that then we have a taxable question, right? Lafayette is
Cheri M.: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: completely separate. They're the insurance company and you will have a private contract with them. So, you'll go on to their website when you want to take a when you want to take money from your policy and that, you know, once we get all the paperwork set up, they'll just EFT it to your bank account.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: And but they do all they do all work together. I guess it's all it all kind of works together. Uh, if that makes sense.
Cheri M.: Sort of kind.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah. And that's okay. You know, a lot of these concepts are upside down and backwards.
 
 
00:44:33
 
Andrew Daniels: Most people don't understand. Here's the big picture view. What I'm trying to do is I'm trying to set you up with a system where you have both and
Cheri M.: Right.
Andrew Daniels: access instead of either or. The whole the whole way you've done your finances up until right now is that you have to decide, do I spend this dollar on bread? Do I save this dollar in my retirement account? Do I pay taxes with this dollar? Do I pay debt with this dollar?
Cheri M.: Gotcha.
Andrew Daniels: This is a way you can do both. you can take a single dollar, run it through your policy, and pay your debt with it. And it seems like a small, it seems like a small distinction, but even a couple even a couple hundred dollars a month worth of that gets enough of a roll that we get away from the credit card credit card debt. Now, there is another there is another option that we could do.
Cheri M.: Oh Lord.
Andrew Daniels: And honestly, if you if you let me keep talking, I will just keep coming up with things.
 
 
00:45:34
 
Andrew Daniels: No, I don't want to confuse you. Um, but no, I think I think it would be reasonable, you know, and this has happened to me before. People learn about what's possible and then their brain starts going. They're like, "Oh man, I, you know, went to Quick Trip and I got a Gatorade. I could have run that through my policy." Like, "Okay, slow down." Usually, you can't even get a big enough policy that makes sense to run every expense through your policy. They won't underwrite you for that much. And it's not necessary to do that. What we're trying to do is we just need to carve out a small space that is a foothold of a foundation and then give it a little bit of time so that we can take care of some of this stuff that's come up as you guys metriculate in this as we look at doing more home path. So, you know, if you were to take the uh let's say two years from now, Home Pass paid you every month, you're really happy with it, you're like, "Hey, I want the rest of the stuff out of the 401k and we're going to home path it." Well,
 
 
00:46:32
 
Andrew Daniels: we couldn't change the policy at that point. It wouldn't make sense to do that, right? But what we could do with that extra income then is we could apply that to outstanding balances on the policy. we could fill up fill up the paid up additions and that is the piece that you get instant cash available for. So we got the base and the paid up additions. I would prefer to have a policy that's only paid up additions but the IRS won't let us do that. Right? So
Cheri M.: Right.
Andrew Daniels: so we have a couple of options if you have extra income that we can set up later on. One of those will be to get rid of the car loan extra fast. And when I
Cheri M.: Yes.
Andrew Daniels: when I calculate that, if we had if there was a way that you could um have a guaranteed income stream, I would say apply all of that towards the payment on the truck because that's by far the most ownorous expense that you have.
 
 
00:47:29
 
Andrew Daniels: That $670 a month is killer. Um I did toy around with the idea of of saying, "Hey, just take the IRA and pay off the truck." I don't like that though. And here's here's something that I think you should consider. I think there's a way that you can have all the money you saved and pay off all your debt and end up with all the money you've saved plus all the money you used to pay off the debt with.
Cheri M.: Okay. All
Andrew Daniels: I'll
Cheri M.: right.
Andrew Daniels: bring that
Cheri M.: That That was a mouthful and a earful.
Andrew Daniels: I'll bring that back around I'll bring that back around to both and not either or. Right now, your whole context is I have to either pay off the truck or pay for my living expenses and there's nothing left to save, right? By running it through here, we're going to do both. And it is in my game plan that you guys will have the truck paid off. Um, I don't have an exact time frame because I want to be respectful of what you want to do, but as soon as you want to do that, I can construct a time frame where that gets paid off.
 
 
00:48:37
 
Andrew Daniels: I had a lady who has a uh 30 she had to get a she had to get a new car and I think it was like $18,000. The game plan that we used with her life insurance, she's running three, four, five, she's running $900 a month through her policy and we've got $18,000 paid off in 20 months. and all of that
Cheri M.: Go.
Andrew Daniels: $900 a month is growing and earning dividends even though she had to take it back out and pay off the car. But it's because the interest and the charges, the the finance charge and the in the monthly payment on the car payment is so insane that we have to get rid of it. We have to prioritize that in order to make everything else work out. And she's gosh, she's 62. She's 62. She's an infection control nurse. She's 62. And so, yeah, she's got like she's going to work for five, seven more years. She likes what she does, but we had to get that car loan out of there and she had to get a car because that's how she gets to work.
 
 
00:49:43
 
Andrew Daniels: So, like there's no room to not do any piece of it. Um,
Cheri M.: Right.
Andrew Daniels: so as you kind of mold this over in your head, one of the key pieces to remember is that we are able to do both and because every time we run any dollar through your policy, it is now eligible for dividends and it grows by a certain amount. So not just the div take the dividend piece out of it. When you put money into your policy, the dollar that you put in comes with a commensurate amount of death benefits. So, let's say you put in a dollar and they agree to pay you $100 if you die. That dollar has to grow up to equal $100 of cash by the time you're 121. So, you're
Cheri M.: I'm not
Andrew Daniels: Yep. So, you're 59 now, right? So, that gives that gives that $1 62 years that it has to turn into $100 next year. same time next year when you're 60, that dollar now only has 61 years to grow.
 
 
00:50:51
 
Andrew Daniels: So
Cheri M.: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: that dollar is going to grow faster. So the longer you have the policy, the older you get, the faster those dollars grow.
Cheri M.: Gotcha.
Andrew Daniels: And that is literally just a component of the fact that they're promising to pay you a death benefit. And if you live to be 121 years old, they'll pay you out all that money. They'll pay you out the whole death benefit, right? You get the whole $100 at 121 if you live that long. But the reason they set it so far out is because they know nobody's going to live that long.
Cheri M.: Right.
Andrew Daniels: We're just taking advantage of that math. And then that's independent of the dividend. So, not only do we have that math, but then we have the dividend stacked on top of that for every dollar you put in there. Add to that the fact that when you take the money back out now, we can get rid of some potentially ownorous payments, right? I don't know what the credit card interest rates are, but they're not they're not 10%.
 
 
00:51:46
 
Andrew Daniels: They're not 9%. They're they're going to be up there. That's just how credit cards are. We need
Cheri M.: Correct.
Andrew Daniels: we need to aggressively attack those. I would say the credit cards are worse than the car payment for sure. Even though
Cheri M.: Oh,
Andrew Daniels: even though the car payment is a higher monthly payment, um the credit cards are taking more actual usable money out of your pocket due to those interest rates. So,
Cheri M.: correct.
Andrew Daniels: what do we do when we pay off the credit cards? Where does those payments go? Those payments go back into the policy to then continue growing. Now, at some point, um, your this this game plan, based on the numbers I'm looking at, will probably be a four to fiveyear game plan, right? And that's, you know, I'm building in some contingencies. I have a game plan for you guys to be able to spend $2,000 per year on a vacation. I know you guys just went on one, was it last year that you guys told me you went on?
 
 
00:52:45
 
Andrew Daniels: So,
Cheri M.: right?
Andrew Daniels: I went ahead and built that in. But if you happen to not take a vacation one year, if it's not a good year, if you just don't get whatever, if you take a thousand dollar vacation, that's just gravy, right? But I wanted to, as I was telling Sherry, I was like, we're not robots. Like, you guys have worked for this long, you deserve to do like do what you want with your life, right? Within the reasons
Cheri M.: Right.
Andrew Daniels: of our goals and our resources. But if you have that $2,000, maybe you guys maybe you guys after after eight or nine months of this, you look at that and you go, "Gosh, we're building up $2,000 worth of um worth of value in our policy. We really want to get rid of that $3,500 credit card go. We're just going to get rid of it." Perfect. You can choose to do that or you can choose to go on vacation and let the credit card payoff thing still happen over the next four or five years.
 
 
00:53:29
 
Andrew Daniels: I'm trying to build in that flexibility and those options. Um because I also don't know you very well, but I do know the number of people who have told me, "I'm gonna do this." And then they do something completely wildly different. Is just about everybody.
Cheri M.: Right.
Andrew Daniels: So I'm not I'm not head faked anymore. So So I love it when you call me and you're like, "Hey, I know I told you I was going to do this, but I'm actually going to do that." And I'm able to go, "Awesome. I actually planned for that. Here's how we're going to make that work." So,
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: um, so as you're thinking through, just consider you now have an option to do a both and strategy. And if we didn't change anything at all, we would have everything except the car, which I hesitated on calculating because I wasn't sure about that. Um, but we'd have the credit cards paid off within four years. you would have a nice sum of money in the life insurance policy, several thousand dollars extra at least to cover emergencies, cover repairs and expenses, things that come up that you would usually use credit card for.
 
 
00:54:33
 
Andrew Daniels: We're not going to use credit cards for those anymore. We're going to use your own financing. And then you guys get to decide, hey, we took $1,000 for tires from our 90-year-old selves. We don't really want to pay it back because we're close enough to retirement. We're not going to do that. Great. you can do that.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: So, um I think with a baseline of 175 and that money is intended to come out of directed IRA, that gives us enough flexibility. I think we can build in the level of room that you would want to uh have available. It won't be $1,000 a month. Um, I I know I can't get that high with that base amount, but it'll be enough that as you start using it, you'll start to see the growth on it happen.
Cheri M.: All right. Now, let me make sure I understand
Andrew Daniels: Sure
Cheri M.: what you're
Andrew Daniels: thing.
Cheri M.: saying. Basically, right now you're saying you're taking $175 a month out of directed IRA, placing it to the insurance policy
 
 
00:55:33
 
Andrew Daniels: Yes.
Cheri M.: for it to grow and for it to be a cash flow for me.
Andrew Daniels: Correct.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: So that that 175 should be supplemented with some other with other things that are in that are already in your budget.
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: So, but it it provides the foundation.
Cheri M.: Basically, you add whether it's the money Charlie gives you or just some money and then run it through. Well, that's what I was going to say. Okay. You're you're taking the 175 from the directed RA. that if I looked at you and said, "Okay, I feel like I can give you $100 a month to go into the cash flow,
Andrew Daniels: the cash uh cash value.
Cheri M.: cash
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Cheri M.: value. I mean, am I on the right
Andrew Daniels: Yes.
Cheri M.: page? Is is this right?" Yes.
Andrew Daniels: Yep.
Cheri M.: No.
Andrew Daniels: No, you're actually you're absolutely on there and you
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: don't have to Well, we'll we'll we'll set up a monthly amount, but you can really we can adjust that.
 
 
00:56:44
 
Andrew Daniels: It's flexible throughout the year. So, one of the pieces we could run is you could say, "Hey, I'm going to start with $100 a month. I want to see it grow. I want to be able to log into my account and see how, you know, what the available loan amount is and everything else, right? And then four months from now, if you want to bump it up to $250 on top of the 175, there will be room available to do that.
Cheri M.: That's that's what I'm kind of So, is there a max
Andrew Daniels: There will
Cheri M.: or
Andrew Daniels: be
Cheri M.: you haven't
Andrew Daniels: there.
Cheri M.: structured
Andrew Daniels: Yes,
Cheri M.: it?
Andrew Daniels: there will be a max that that we'll have to calculate and that is dependent on how we get that base and that midline set up.
Cheri M.: Okay. And are you going to um put this all like on paper so I can Well, I mean when I say paper, I mean you email something to me so I can like, you know, physically
 
 
00:57:31
 
Andrew Daniels: Uhhuh.
Cheri M.: see
Andrew Daniels: Yes. So, I'm going to use I'm going to use this as our as our game plan here, right? Uh this software
Cheri M.: and she would explain that to me if I don't understand.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. So, right here, so we can see the growth of and I'm calling the life insurance policy the sure wealth store. And I don't know if you can see this uh
Cheri M.: I have to hold it because that's small.
Andrew Daniels: yeah, but this this number here, this protected asset is life insurance. And so these are the values that grow up through that, right?
Cheri M.: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: So,
Cheri M.: All
Andrew Daniels: we will once I get the once I get the exact numbers down, I'll put it in here so we can see the real impact to your whole right. We want to see the whole picture all the way out. If you put this amount of money in, here's when we're going to redline. Here's when you're supposed to be out of money.
 
 
00:58:32
 
Andrew Daniels: Here's here's what you still have left in the policy. Some of these aren't quite right yet because I haven't I haven't finished putting the numbers in.
Cheri M.: right.
Andrew Daniels: But this is what we'll use. And then obviously the policy does come with an illustration. So like well so for this example, we're assuming that the life insurance money is non-touchable. I don't think that's really how we're going to use it either, but I like to put it in protected because then the software doesn't pull out for monthly cash flow. That it kind of makes things a little weird. Um but yes, I will have it all lined out for you. Um, and the policy itself has an illustration, and I've gota we have to be careful with those because they're they're very static. Um, an illustration that I show you day one is not going to be the same as the illustration six months in, if that makes sense.
Cheri M.: Okay,
Andrew Daniels: Um, because it changes every time you put a premium in, it changes how all the numbers calculate.
 
 
00:59:29
 
Cheri M.: gotcha.
Andrew Daniels: So, um, so I I'll we'll we will go through that once we get it, um, once we get these numbers kind of set up. Um, and then, you know, we'll have lots of chances to ask questions. I've I've already called them and I said, you know, Melissa is going to take a policy. We just need to get all the we need to get all the details in place and everything. And so, they've just got a hold on your application for now where they're just like, all right, we approved it. Let us know when she's ready.
Cheri M.: All righty.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. So, that was a lot. Any other questions?
Cheri M.: I don't think so.
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Cheri M.: Well, that was enough for now
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Cheri M.: that
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. This is a this is a way that you can get both. And um and the best thing I can relate it to, it's actually very similar to what you're doing with your credit cards. You're putting money, you're spending on your credit card to get a dividend, your cash back, right?
 
 
01:00:28
 
Andrew Daniels: And you're
Cheri M.: Right.
Andrew Daniels: putting money,
Cheri M.: Correct.
Andrew Daniels: you're you're putting expenses onto the debit card or onto the credit card, and then you pay it back
Cheri M.: Correct.
Andrew Daniels: with your check. That is a very similar process to what I'm suggesting. The crux of the issue is in this scenario when we replace life insurance for the credit card, not only is life insurance an asset instead of a liability, they're going to grow instead of charge. The other
Cheri M.: Correct.
Andrew Daniels: piece of it is you presumably are not an owner in your credit card company.
Cheri M.: Gotcha.
Andrew Daniels: You are an owner in the life insurance company by virtue of having the type of policy that you have.
Cheri M.: Got
Andrew Daniels: So,
Cheri M.: you.
Andrew Daniels: you can do I say almost all the same things because you can actually do more with the policy than you can with the credit card, but you can do the same strategy that you've already kind of uh discovered and uncovered. We're just going to change the nature of what what's what's supporting it so that instead of costing you money, it's going to earn you money.
 
 
01:01:29
 
Andrew Daniels: We just need to flip some of the variables.
Cheri M.: Gotcha.
Andrew Daniels: People
Cheri M.: Gotcha.
Andrew Daniels: do this kind of strategy with home equity line of credit. They do it with reverse mortgages. They do it with credit cards. They do it you could do it with a savings account if you really wanted to. You could do it with a savings account. All of those have their advantages and their disadvantages. The list of advantages when you own it and it's an asset and it has a dividend and it's based on your life expectancy, which for you, you could live to be 105, right? That means you would have more time to accumulate cash, right? Or you could die
Cheri M.: Right.
Andrew Daniels: tomorrow, right? Like that's that's kind of the when you have those factors in play, that's what makes it so powerful.
Cheri M.: I'm batting batting 98.
Andrew Daniels: Let's go somewhere. Yeah, let's go somewhere in between. Give you another 30 years.
Cheri M.: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Um so yeah, as you're as you're thinking about that, obviously we're gonna we're going to work on constructing the policy, but just kind of mle over in your brain how you're already using the credit card strategy to get some additional mojo. Imagine if you owned the credit card company and if it was an asset that kicked off earnings rather than interest charges.
Cheri M.: got you.
Andrew Daniels: I think that can kind of help close the loop, too.
Cheri M.: Yep.
Andrew Daniels: So, um yeah. All right. You're going to think of some questions. You'll go home and at like 10:30 tonight, you're going to be laying down, your eyes be closed, and you go, "Wait a minute. What about this?" Just write it down.

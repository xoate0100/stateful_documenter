Andrew Daniels: Hello. How are you guys doing?
Miranda Wood: Hello. I'm good. How are you?
Andrew Daniels: All so I think some things have changed since we last chatted.
Miranda Wood: I'm definitely run. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: That's so the numbers are probably going to change on everything I sent to you guys. but it's okay. I'm used to This happens more often than you think. So, I'm sorry it took me a minute. I got completely knocked out with It has to have been co I was just down and it was my birthday weekend and I just crashed. I was like,…
Miranda Wood: That's a B.
Andrew Daniels: " horrible way to do it." But I finally am back on I'm in the office this week.
Andrew Daniels: I was in the office last week, so catching up.
Miranda Wood: Yeah. …
Andrew Daniels: So, did you guys get a chance to take a look at the report that I sent?
Miranda Wood: yeah. Marina saw the report. she just kind of tells me it'll work,…
Andrew Daniels: Okay. …
Miranda Wood: it won't. I mean, he's a new person. That's way beyond what my stuff. So, all right.
Andrew Daniels: yeah. Yeah. the number one thing I want to make sure of is that you guys have confidence in what we're doing. you need to know that you've made a good decision. And then I think what happens is as people start to use the different parts and pieces that we have set up, I think it becomes more clear like, this is when I'm supposed to use this.
Andrew Daniels: This is why it works. And so you're going to have pretty much the exact same 11 questions for me for about two years. And then you'll start coming to me being like, hey, we did this And I'm great. That's exactly what I would have suggested anyways. So some of it's having it set up. Some of it is practicing using it in a way that makes sense.
Andrew Daniels: and then I think it'll eventually click in your brain. So, let's see. Do I need to admit Miranda or…
Miranda Wood: Yeah, makes sense.
Andrew Daniels: is she in the same room with you? Okay, perfect. No worries. I want to make sure we got everybody on there that we're supposed to have.
Miranda Wood: She's actually working in a different room right now.
Miranda Wood: She's right here. Yeah, she's working. This meeting is running really long.
Andrew Daniels: No worries. I'll get some of the basics and you can join us whenever. So, what do you have the numbers for how things have changed? I'm going to create a new scenario with the new stuff. That way, I'll just kind of track it and then I'll kind of merge everything back together. It'll take me a little bit after we get off the call to merge it all back together.
Miranda Wood: Yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: So major update, you guys bought a house. That's done. That's official.
Miranda Wood: Yeah. We're just waiting for the closing date,…
Miranda Wood: the 29th.
Andrew Daniels: …
Andrew Daniels: did we use any of the assets that you guys have set aside for down payment from 401ks or the Roth or anything like that?
Miranda Wood: So we just wiped out our savings really is…
Miranda Wood: what it came down to. We sold our stock, everything but and we're going to use that
Andrew Daniels: Okay. let me put this up here so you can see this. okay.
Andrew Daniels: So you guys are pretty much using this entire balance of pretty much all of these 401ks and Roths, right? we're liquidated all of that.
Miranda Wood: video right here.
Miranda Wood: No, no, just No, no, no, no. We only liquidated 6,000 from that LPL Financial.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Right.
Andrew Daniels: This one.
Miranda Wood: No.
Miranda Wood: Heaven forbid. No, no, no. We are super zoomed in. Why are we so zoomed in? This is your computer. I have no idea. no. So, we just did that 6,000. And so, it's in our Capital One savings now.
Andrew Daniels: But that's got to be allocated for down payment, right? Okay.
Miranda Wood: Yes. Yes. It's
Andrew Daniels: Not an entirely.
Andrew Daniels: That doesn't actually throw And did you still have the 4,000 in the savings? So now you have 10 total, right? And is that all that whole amount is going to go towards down payment? I'm guessing. Okay.
Miranda Wood: No.
Miranda Wood: I mean, we're going to leave at least a thousand in there. as There we go. It's what the heck? We are just my face. we're leaving at least a thousand in there. and then I mean a little bit of my paycheck is adding towards it…
Miranda Wood: because I think we only need 12 for closing. So, …
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Miranda Wood: All in down payment and everything. I think it they would said they're haven't gotten a full thing yet because I'm still waiting on insurance quotes. but it should come to around 12,500 all in for closing. So yeah,…
00:05:00
Andrew Daniels: Got it. no worries.
Miranda Wood: I wouldn't need any of that. Okay.
Andrew Daniels: No worries. this is how we track that. and I'm going to go through how I got some of those numbers. So, first, okay, I don't think this throws off my game plan at all, which is actually kind of surprisingly cool because you guys might and I love this whole process because you guys I think you could probably have your cake and eat it too. I am surprised by this, but I'm also not surprised because I do this all the time.
Andrew Daniels: It's just every time it happens this way, I'm like, how are we able to fit all of this together all at once? It doesn't like I'm not sure. So, let's So, I'm gonna pull Yes.
Miranda Wood: It probably helps that we literally were living on basically one and…
Miranda Wood: then mine is kind of savings, debt, like all of So,…
Andrew Daniels: And in the report that I sent you, I did not even include the ramp up of the counseling business. that's not like a capp thing.
Miranda Wood: yeah.
Andrew Daniels: eventually there will be a limit to how much you can personally do, but that should ramp up quite a bit more.
Miranda Wood: Mhm. I love that.
Andrew Daniels: And I just assumed that it was any other job where it was going to stay basically level. So if you have any measure of success there at all, it's just going to be gravy on top of whatever we design. Right. Right.
Miranda Wood: I like kind of keeping it as a base and then, Yeah. Okay.
Andrew Daniels: So I decided okay, it's a business.
Andrew Daniels: I love the potential of a business, but let's assume it never grows beyond that. Will we still be okay? I think mentally that should help take the pressure off you guys of my gosh, we have to get the …
Miranda Wood: Mhm. Okay.
Andrew Daniels: yeah, you want to grow, but be purposeful. Don't take on clients that are going to drain you just because you need an extra $30 that week. I want to make sure that you guys have this quality of life in addition to this consistency that we're going to try and set up here. okay. So, what I did was let me see if I can pull this report real quick and I'm going to switch the screen out so you guys can see. We'll go through the report together and then we can update the numbers and I'm hoping I can still rearrange things.
Andrew Daniels: But just kind of off the top of my head, it doesn't look like it's going to cause a huge challenge to you guys to buy the house and keep going with the plan I set up, which is I would not have been able to predict that, I don't think. pulling up this report here. Sorry, the internet's being a little slow today. There it goes.
Andrew Daniels: There It Come on now. Holy moly. I have a thousand windows up. So yeah,…
Miranda Wood: My computer took forever last night to upload one video.
Miranda Wood: So it was an hour long video for my yoga certification, so I get it. But that took forever. So okay.
Andrew Daniels: that's a little long. Yeah, it's 2025.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, so this is the report that you guys saw.
Miranda Wood: Mh All right.
Andrew Daniels: Basically it's just like this is the scenario. Everything in this report is current with no changes except for at the very end I show the impact of doing different changes, So this assumes that you're still putting away for education, you're still paying down the car $100 a month faster. It's basically the current scenario. this is just some information on social security and how that changes over the years.
Andrew Daniels: This is the complete listing of all the assets that we had in there. And of course, as soon as I go through and update these numbers, it's going to change. because we're going to show how that $10,000 comes out of these accounts and goes towards the house payment. and then we want to keep track. This is just kind of as we go forward, we're going to keep track of the taxes and how that might impact you guys at retirement.
Miranda Wood: Okay.  Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: less concerning for you this second. But I will tell you the more time we have to plan for taxes, at 70, the easier it is to get down to basically zero taxable income in retirement. The reason for that is because we want to make sure that if you have too much other income, your social security up to 80% of your social security then becomes taxable.
Andrew Daniels: And it's like this whole snake eating its own tail thing where you save up money in pre-tax retirement accounts and then you get taxed on that forced withdrawal and your social security becomes taxable. So I've had situations where people will call me at 72 and they're like I don't need to take this money but I'm being forced to take this money and now it's creating a doubly large tax bill. At 72 it's really hard to reorganize things because it just gets too costly.  you guys have an opportunity because we're 30 years away from your retirement. So, we'll be able to solve that. We just want to make sure we look at it ahead of time. and then the software it doesn't do automatic payments on loans and stuff, but this is more just for our information. Here's all the outstanding debts that we've got left, right? So, I've got the therapy payback in there. We've got that current car loan that you guys are trying to pay down.
00:10:00
Andrew Daniels: We've got the student loan that's almost gone.
Andrew Daniels: The two student loans that we don't know what's going to happen. I'm just going to set those aside for the moment and you just update me "Hey, we heard from whoever's managing it. This is what we're supposed to do. So, we'll deal with it as it comes." Have you gotten any documentation on that or…
Miranda Wood: It might move.
Miranda Wood: It's going private. Yeah. Yeah. That's what they said. So, …
Andrew Daniels: No. Okay.
Miranda Wood: I'm about to be in school deferment, so mine's not going to matter here in a minute. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: And that's the kind of thing for those the amounts are so there's no way we're going to take 115,000 and just wipe it out all at once right now. Anyways, so I would say there's a ton of individual loans, but for both of those categories, I'm going to say for the student loans, let's set them aside.
Andrew Daniels: make whatever minimum payment you're told to make and we'll adjust the cash flow accordingly. my idea for you guys for that is that we will build up your capital with the life insurance policies with the Shwell store with your personal capital castle so to speak.  As those balances grow in that side, there is a strategy where we can take money from that, wipe out the loans entirely, and then you will be able to fund and put money back into your own pocket at your own pace, never having to ask anybody for a repayment schedule, whatever. You guys can just have complete control over that.  and at your age and stage of life, I'm completely confident that by the time you need to withdraw those funds again, we can get money back in there, And we want it to be a revolving door for a lot of reasons.
Andrew Daniels: And we're going to set it up so that it's tax-free. so that the net cost of that revolving door is very very low. at worst 2%, right, for the net cost of that, which because all that money goes back into your own pocket, you could argue that it's not really a cost. I'm going to go worst case scenario and say even if that 2% never came back into your other pocket, will you still be okay cash flow-wise?
Miranda Wood: turn to Yes.
Andrew Daniels: Right? That revolving door then is what we're going to use not just to pay off your student loans, but then we're going to piggy back on that. And luckily, how old's your daughter? She's two. Perfect. So, what we'll do is we're going to use that revolving door. At some point, we'll take care of all of your student loans, whether that's in one lump sum or we knock a few off as those balances grow up.
Andrew Daniels: on this side. We may knock there might be a $900 student loan and we could just take care of it in one day. There might be others where we have to funnel kind of consistent money every quarter to pay it down quicker or whatever. and I have all kinds of calculators. We can figure out the optimal solution.  But I think just to keep it high level, just know at some point between now and 65, we're going to wipe out those student loans and take them from an asset on the bank's balance sheet and we're going to make them an asset on your balance sheet, which changes the whole repayment thing, if you're taking money from your left pocket and you got to give it to somebody else where you never see it again, or you could take money from your left pocket and then just put it right back into your own right pocket.
Andrew Daniels: That situation's better. Most people are super happy to just be like, " I'm gonna put it from here to over there." That's what we're gonna set up.
Miranda Wood: Yeah. Acting like you're still paying the loan,…
Miranda Wood: but you're paying yourself back.
Andrew Daniels: It just goes to your 65ar-old self instead of some fat cap banker, and you get all the flexibility, too. If you guys get in a situation where you need to lower payments for a little bit and what I'm thinking of for you guys is 18 years from now. Let's say we have wiped out all the external student loans and it's all just effectively inside your own system and your daughter goes to go to college. She needs a car. She needs money for the dorm. She's got to pay books and all this stuff. We've got scholarships and everything.
00:15:00
Andrew Daniels: You guys might decide, hey, we're going to lower our own student loan payment for a bit for a couple of years while she's in college so that we have more capital to be able to pull out and do whatever. You're going to have all that flexibility. What I find is that when parents have kids that are in college or getting into college, there's this period where you spend you have a lot of money and I'm right there with you. I have five kids so my outlay is stupid right now, right?
Andrew Daniels: But there will be a point there is a light at the end of the tunnel where your kids get launched. They are out on their own. They have their first big people job. social media manager, administrative, whatever it is that they're doing, right? They are by and large able to cover a lot of their own expenses.
Miranda Wood: All right.
Andrew Daniels: And I think the way I do planning, especially for people with kids, you're going to have outlays for your children until they're like 30. Let's just plan on that, right? You're going to need to be able to help. we should just plan on having it be there. If you don't have to spend it, great. It's extra. But as long as we know it's there, then you can properly help your child get launched all the way through to, being a functioning adult. after that point though, you're going to have this period where you still have working years. I've got people who they don't want to just sit around and twiddle their thumbs at 62, right? They want to do something.
Andrew Daniels: So, when you're in your 60s and 70s, for us our age right now, it feels like, you're going to be an old fddy duddy, right? Most people in their 60s and 70s do still work. They still want to do something. and so there's these income generative years where you don't have the outlay of raising kids or getting them launched, but you're going to have all this extra cash flow. It's not like you're buying a new car every year. You're not buying a new house every year.  So after this launching period, regardless of where we've got loans out or we've taken and refinanced things back into your own system, you will have a lot of cash to be able to then fund back into your own system. And the benefit that you guys have that most people that I work with is that you're starting this system 25 years early.
Andrew Daniels: This is how I figure this Most people come to me and they're 58 to 62 and they have to start their stuff now, but they lose the benefit of having 25 years worth of growth and snowballing and everything else.
Miranda Wood: I don't think so. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: When I do this for anybody under 40, the numbers look stupid. We were able to do things like buy a house and continue everything we planned. So, okay, that was the sidebar. Any questions on that though? So, we're going to track liabilities, and we just have to kind of manually go in and update these as those balances change, so we don't lose track of them. It's not going to automatically update this part. here's where I did some analysis. So, if we just let things continue the way they are with a reasonable interest rate, I just kind of said, what if you make 4% on all the spots where you got your money?
Andrew Daniels: That would be great if you could do that. It would be great if what you had with the other,…
Miranda Wood: Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: market advisors had even done that, instead of losing money, let's just make 4%. So, I'm trying to give the market guys the best let's assume that you can make 4% and not lose their money. we still run into a challenge with the way the cash flow was working. And this is even with the, $1,200 a month going in for savings, paying off the car early, we had set end dates on those loans all the loans for the payments. So even with the payments dropping off, it became immediately apparent that we have to get some extra mojo. We need a third payer into your system. and keep in mind this is a worst case scenario.
Andrew Daniels: This is if your counseling business never grows beyond 3% per year.
Miranda Wood: Yeah, I like that angle.
Andrew Daniels: This is assuming Miranda, this doesn't take into account any of the bonuses that you might get with John Deere. So, I'm trying to make it as hard as possible for myself. what is the worst case scenario that we could solve for? And then as these good things happen financially. What I'd like to do is I'd like to make sure that we have a spot that's tax advantaged, that's purposeful, that you can always access. You're going to know, Miranda, when you get John Deere money, if they give you that bonus,
Andrew Daniels: you'll know exactly where to put it to make sure that you get issued dividends on that for the rest of your life, even if you have to take it back out and spend it.
Andrew Daniels: we're gonna create all the spots for the good stuff, but we're gonna plan as if none of the good stuff happens, And that way you guys have confidence. here's the difference between the two, right? okay, so first off, do you guys have any questions? You saw this.
Miranda Wood: Yeah. Yeah.
00:20:00
Andrew Daniels: What are your impressions? what do you think about the difference between the two scenarios?
Miranda Wood: I mean,…
Miranda Wood: one is 40 years later, so that's a little hard to compare because it's 55 and 59. You're saying we're essentially going to run out of money…
Miranda Wood: if we retire at 52. which is fair.
Andrew Daniels: Right.
Andrew Daniels: No, that retirement on the current scenario, the retirement still at 65 on both of them,…
Miranda Wood: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: the problem is it didn't go past 55 and 59 because that was all the money there was.
Miranda Wood: That's so sad. That is very sad.
Miranda Wood: And then you have us I mean the 3 million is very nice but it's at 101.
Andrew Daniels: …
Miranda Wood: So that's like or else not I'm sorry I love you but I don't think you're going to live to average white 77 statistically.
Andrew Daniels: let me So,…
Miranda Wood: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: let me switch then and we'll do the live view so that you can see kind of apples to apples on the age what that looks like. so let's see on the income. So we can see that I've got you guys. what? I think you are right, Miranda. This end age needs to be out to 65.
Miranda Wood: essentially.
Andrew Daniels: It's still not going to make it look any better. It's still going to be out of money quicker. But instead of 55 Yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: So you can see as soon as you go to stop working if we didn't mess with anything and we assume that your market advisors can get you 4% every year without going backwards at all. pretty much the day you go to retire, you don't have enough money to keep going.
Miranda Wood: you can't make it then that's the worst ever.
Andrew Daniels: Right. Right.
Miranda Wood: It's saying you can never retire…
Andrew Daniels: Right. Yes,…
Miranda Wood: because you would not be able to survive. So love Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: and so if we go to this we can look at these quick views too. and I can change the age. Let's see. let me just go to the other scenario and we can look we go. And so on the optimized side, we can see we're still at 65. there we go.
Andrew Daniels: We're still at 65, but now we have significant asset growth at 65. and there's a couple of things that I did. And what I did was the first thing I did was I said, "Let's take care of the car loan immediately, today. Get that gone before we even do anything else." And the reason I did that is…
Andrew Daniels: because as I was looking through this and that's not grandma's car loan, by the way. We're going to take grandma up on her offer.
Miranda Wood: The one that actually has interest on it.
Miranda Wood: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: Yes, we're going to take grandma up on her offer and we'll just pay her out over the next five years. there's actually cash flow to be able to do that. So I want to make sure that grandma gets paid because I think that's a great resource that you guys have.
Andrew Daniels: You have someone in an older generation willing to offer their capital to help you guys get the assets that you need for life.
Andrew Daniels: Who's that? okay. Hey, if any of my kids might come in,…
Miranda Wood: Charlotte, she requested more.
Miranda Wood: She is getting more apple juice.
Andrew Daniels: too. They do not understand a door. they don't care.
Miranda Wood: Yes, he is.
Andrew Daniels: Hello. How are you,…
Miranda Wood: That is you and a pumpkin on a different one. Say hi, Andy. She doesn't know…
Andrew Daniels: Charlotte? No,…
Miranda Wood: where to look.
Andrew Daniels: that's fine. We're talking about you going to college.
Miranda Wood: Slow down, Slow down.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, We're not there yet. We're just going to work on numbers and letters for now. No, that's fine.
Andrew Daniels: One of the things that I did notice, there's a calculation that I look for, and it's basically a ratio of the payment that you owe every month to the outstanding balance that's currently on there, And this is kind of how I decided on The student loan payments are so low and the balance is so high, there's no chance we're even going to take care of the balance with what you have anyway. So, we just have to let those sit. But the car loan, you guys actually have enough funds sitting out there that we can take care of that. In this market environment, there's nothing you're going to do to outpace the car loan safely. And so, you're just spending money on interest that we can just get rid of right now. And that frees up $470 a month in cash flow. what we do with that then, and I'll 570.
Miranda Wood: plus an additional 100 that we were throwing at technically 570.
Andrew Daniels: Yes, I did.
Andrew Daniels: I did actually, so you can see where I made a note and I cut off the actual expense.
00:25:00
Miranda Wood: Yeah, you made it zero. Yeah. Let's go.
Andrew Daniels: So that's how I kind of know that it's going to work out. I did the same thing with grandma's car loan, the therapy payout, and What else? the additional car payment. So, I zeroed those out, but it's not that we're not going to pay them. it's that we're gonna kind of redirect them first and then make the payments so that you can have all of that money. Once you run it into your system, it will be credited as dividend paying amounts for the rest of your life. And this is how this is…
Miranda Wood: That is an Amazon box.
Andrew Daniels: It's how we get that snowball going so good that at 65 you end up with almost $4 million of assets.
Miranda Wood: Yes. Go back to watching your show.
Andrew Daniels: They're so I love it.
Andrew Daniels: I love two-olds. Put me in a room full of two-year-olds. I would be so happy.
Andrew Daniels: Even if they're throwing tantrums, I'm like, " you guys are so cute with your tantrums. I know you wanted the blue crayon.
Miranda Wood: Yeah, that is an old Amazon box.
Miranda Wood: Yeah, we're moving. So, we got to save every box we got.
Andrew Daniels: Let's see.
Miranda Wood: Are you literally luring her like a dog with apple juice? No, I can't.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. …
Miranda Wood: So, when you're saying redirect them, you're saying put them into the life  to pay the life insurance and then immediately take them back out to
Andrew Daniels: we'll do a portion of it because if we get rid of your car loan, that gives us a little bit of cushion where you can just run it in there. You could take it back out any time, That 570. You probably based on what I'm seeing, you won't have to take it right back out. So, as that builds up, then we'll be able to pay off other debts or whatever.
Andrew Daniels: If you look here, so you can see where I've got that car loan payoff happening immediately,…
Miranda Wood: Okay. How sorry I just…
Andrew Daniels: but then I have the …
Miranda Wood: How are we doing that immediately? where is this 14 15 grand coming from?
Andrew Daniels: we'll just Yeah, good question. Hold on. So, what I've got we're going to grab it from the Mercy 401k and then we'll take it from the LPL Financial.
Miranda Wood: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: I have the taxes on that tracked and I have the penalty tracked. And you guys don't have to do this, but if you told me that you absolutely didn't want to do it, I think I could illustrate and find some other ways to make sense. it would just take here's the thing.
Andrew Daniels: It would probably extend the time frame of starting the third payer part of the program by about 18 to 24 months. And I don't see a reason why you need to simultaneously take a beating in the market and pay somebody else interest when we could just stop the bleeding now and then start growing without any other external factors. Does that make sense?
Miranda Wood: Okay.
Miranda Wood: Yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: So yeah,…
Miranda Wood: No, you're but keep the John Deere contributions going cuz it's like Yeah,…
Andrew Daniels: because they Yeah.
Miranda Wood: it's like I put it I think they already have 500 in there from two paychecks and that's them paying it, not me paying it.
Andrew Daniels: So I would keep that. Whatever the minimum is you have to do to get their free money,…
Miranda Wood: Okay. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: I'm okay with that. I think that's totally fine.
Miranda Wood: Okay. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Miranda Wood: Yeah. I think it's like I pay 400 and then they pay almost a,000. it's in.
Andrew Daniels: And I also have that tracked as well.
Miranda Wood: Okay. Okay.
Andrew Daniels: So, if we look at this retirement part of and you can see these little I don't let me see if I can zoom in and make it a little bit there we go. So, you can see we do have that John Deere growing as And so, that does become a really important part of that. and here's the thing, like while you're working at a company, there's a couple of things. First off, hopefully you work at John Deere until the day you retire. I'm probably going to assume that you're not going to end up doing that. There may come a point where the boss that hired you is not the boss that you currently have, and it may not be as great of a fit, whatever. Right? When you move on from that company,…
Miranda Wood: Mhm. Okay.
Andrew Daniels: that's when you unlock access to do other things with those funds.
Andrew Daniels: and we get that third payer into the system. That's not illustrated here. we still haven't done that part, but at any point if you do, we can stop the market losses on that account and start to utilize it, So even if it takes till you're 55 and you have that in the market the whole time, great. It's going to do whatever it's going to do. I know what I do for other 55 year olds between 55 and 65. I'll just do that for you between 55 and 65 on top of everything else you've already done. If that makes sense. So, this is literally with the bare minimum amount of effort of just reorganizing a couple of things but leaving a lot in place. This is how you guys can kind of really shore up your game plan very early on. and…
00:30:00
Miranda Wood: Yeah, I think getting rid of that car payment…
Andrew Daniels: of course, yeah.
Miranda Wood: because it's just so annoying. That would be very helpful. essentially almost $600 and…
Miranda Wood: then paying off Ashley that frees up another $600. So there's $1,200 a month that just gets freed up to do.
Andrew Daniels: I've got that I do have that in here as well.
Andrew Daniels: The therapy payback, one of the things that we need to maybe look at that probably is now very relevant is I had considered paying that back all at once, but here's the thing. She's not charging you interest. If she already offered to have you pay it off over time,…
Miranda Wood: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: take the deal. Right? It's not going to cost you any more or any less. You might as well run that through your system first. Capture $640 a month of dividends and Earl, I don't know if this is what they do. When you run the money into your policy, these are very specific types of policies.
Andrew Daniels: they will credit that money as eligible to earn dividends for the rest of your life. And if we have to run 640 into it on May 1st and then May 3rd,…
Andrew Daniels: you have to take 640 back out because you got to pay her, They don't care if you've taken it back out. Once it crosses that gate, it is eligible for dividends and growth for the rest of your life. you've never had a bank account that does that. Right. It's nuts.
Miranda Wood: still sounds illegal.
Miranda Wood: I told him this sounds illegal.
Andrew Daniels: So, No, I get that. And that's a valid concern. And what I think happens is I think people understand, especially financially, we know there are no free lunches, We know that that's never a thing in the financial world. And if it is, you should run away because it's probably not true, right? This is not that.
Andrew Daniels: The second thing is I think people have an understanding if it goes up on one side, it has to go down on the other even if it's not the same entity, So you're not getting this freeforno thing from the life insurance company. Here's what's actually going on. They will only allow certain types of policies to be treated that way. You can't just buy anything from any company and have this provision. Has to be the right company that even offers it.  And even then, they've got 40 different products that they sell, right? These three are eligible to be able to do that back and forth with and still get the crediting.
Andrew Daniels: So what's happening is all these other products, the annuities, the term insurance, the disability insurance, all that stuff, the profit from those goes to cover the business provision of the types of policies we're going to look for that allow you to put money in, take it back out, and still get generated interest. They are able to do that because of the profit from all the other products in their portfolio that are not eligible for that treatment.  and they're just something they decided they wanted to offer as a benefit to get people to, come to their company. There are some companies where it's their whole business. They're like, "We know people use it for this. We're going to make sure that it works this way." And the reason I choose certain companies is also based on how we plan to use it. There are sometimes where it's not a good fit because somebody's not actually going to do that.
Andrew Daniels: I'm gonna encourage you guys to use this process this way because with young families with children, it has been consistently the best strategy to help young families with children who have a lot of outlay in the form of we're going to have to buy cars, we're going to have to buy clothes, we're going to have to buy school gear, we're going to have to get college funded somehow, and then we're also going to have to fund our retirement out of all of this. Having this as the foundation and then giving you guys the flexibility to ramp up or ramp down your expenses with this strategy can give you that flexibility as things happen.
Andrew Daniels: Good things are going to happen, bad things are going to happen. You're going to have to replace the air conditioner or something, right? This will be where we go for that to keep you out of debt.
Miranda Wood: We don't have one.
Miranda Wood: The house doesn't have one. It has a wall unit, so it needs a mini split. So,
Andrew Daniels: So, okay, here's what we do. Cash flow.
Andrew Daniels: We are going to say we're gonna have to spend Mini split install.
Andrew Daniels: And I just bought a mini split two years ago. It was $12,000 to get it installed.
Miranda Wood: Yeah,…
Miranda Wood: that's what I'm looking at. that's number. I'm like,…
00:35:00
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Miranda Wood: okay, what's a mini split compared to a central air unit? 12 to 20 grand. That's
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, it's probably about the same. Yeah. So hopefully you guys can get something for less or you can get a deal with a, friend or a builder or something. But yeah.
Miranda Wood: I know David could put it in.
Andrew Daniels: So is that something you're going to do right away or…
Miranda Wood: You could probably get it wholesale, too. Grandma David. He does air conditioners. That's up to No, we don't got 12 grand. not I don't know. I mean, probably within the next year. The problem is they say that if you don't the summers are what? No, the winter because it's baseboard heat. which is electric so super pricey. They're like it could be a $500 a month utility bill and I'm like ouch.
Miranda Wood: 
Andrew Daniels: I'm done. Yeah.
Miranda Wood: But I was like the downstairs I'm not as worried about because it's a mini it's like a B level so it's like a half basement kind of thing. They're like the B downstairs is pretty much kind of the same air, but the upstairs can get kind of hot and…
Miranda Wood: you can get kind of cold. So they're like, "Yeah, it depends on how hot, how you set your thermostat, but it could be $500." And I'm like, so
Andrew Daniels: …
Andrew Daniels: we're gonna have a So, we need to make a So, I'll redo this, but I've got some I already am thinking worst case scenario mindset of if the electric bill's higher than expected? what I'm going to do here's what I'm going to do as we build this. What I like to do is I like to say, "Okay, here's the absolute bare minimum that we need to put into this system that I'm proposing to keep it alive." Right?
Miranda Wood: There's done.
Andrew Daniels: Here's the middle ground of what we think we can do. Just any regular month that's a normal month, this is what we're going to do. And then I'll put in a top line.
Andrew Daniels: if the bonus comes in from John Deere, Earl, if you get 10 new customers all of a sudden and your income kind of ramps up and we see that it's stable for two or three months, you guys might say, "Hey, we're going to bump up so that we can get closer to that maximum." The goal would be that you guys fund the policies to the maximum limit every year. But the way I'm going to set it up, you're only obligated really to do the bare minimum.  And so I'm gonna give you a pretty wide range of flexibility on those policies because I know stuff happens like I've been doing this long enough. People will tell me, "No, my situation's perfect. It's never going to change." And then they'll go and buy a house and I'm like, "Okay, scrap everything. We'll go back to the drawing board." or they lose their job three weeks after we set everything up. All of that. I'm that happens.
Andrew Daniels: And the goal of everything that I'm going to do with how we set this up is to provide you guys maximum flexibility and control in a way people that don't work with me have never experienced this. But that's why I want to get the car payment out of there. That seems to be the most ownorous monthly expense and…
Andrew Daniels: you guys have enough in there that we can kind of just rearrange things. That alone, if that's all you did, you would have a lot more breathing room than you currently do, than it feels like you currently do.
Miranda Wood: Yeah. Yeah.
Miranda Wood: Because with all it's like We feel like I mean my paycheck it's a good paycheck but it's all going towards bills,…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah.
Miranda Wood: which is nice because we can, dedicate kind of his, we have more breathing room than we did two months ago. so
Andrew Daniels: One of the things that I'm actually thinking of with this air conditioner, if we take care of the car pretty quickly is the kind of one of the very first things. If we take care of the car, you be able to then what we'll do is we'll keep that same payment or that amount that 570. We're just going to redirect it into a safe spot that grows until let's say you guys put off the mini split and…
Miranda Wood: Mhm. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: just for one year at Not really payments, but just 12 months of saving $570. There's $6,800 right there. And so just on that alone, we've now cut the effective cost of your mini split from 14 down to nine pretty quick and eight or nine. Right.
Andrew Daniels: So right I just want to kind of start talking to you guys and so that you can hear how the in always There's an up and a And so the way that this works is not like your car insurance or your home owners. It's not an expense that goes into a black hole that you never see again, right? Those kinds of insuranceances, you hope that the event that you're insuring against never happens, right?  But because we're going to base this on life insurance and your guys' lives, we know unless you have figured something out that We know that death will eventually happen. it is what it is. That means the financial nature of the product is completely flipped upside down on its head. Most people don't realize that and they're not using it like that, so let me see where I'm looking at. I was going to try and put that in here, but we don't need to worry about that.
00:40:00
Andrew Daniels: I'm gonna make a note and I'll kind of fiddle around with the numbers on the mini split and the electric bill. I think those are pretty valid concerns for me.
Miranda Wood: And I set the electric bill at $300.
Miranda Wood: Because they said In the winter it could be 500. So I just set it at $300 a month.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, absolutely.
Miranda Wood: And then if we're less great, if we're more, it should kind of even itself out throughout the year. so that's kind of why I said it like that.
Andrew Daniels: No, I think that's probably the most reasonable way to do it. so going along with this game plan because I haven't even gotten to the exciting part yet. so I planned on paying back as Ashley with the therapy loan. Yeah, don't try to accelerate that at all. She's not charging you interest. And that's her Okay.
Miranda Wood: Then We can lower it to 420 then if we're not going to accelerate it because that would be over a year. because 640 was accelerating it to get it out of the way.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: And you can see here I had calculated from May through November. So So I'll let you decide if you want to lower it. won't change much.
Miranda Wood: It doesn't matter.
Andrew Daniels: Or you can keep it there and just get her out of your life so you don't have to deal with her anymore. there is some of that…
Miranda Wood: It's not on. Yeah. Earl's like, I'm done. I'm done.  That's good.
Andrew Daniels: where we're not robots right we can talk about optimizing everything on the numbers but there is a little bit of a quality of life like you don't every time you make that payment or see it come out of your account you're like that was such a terrible experience I don't want to think about it anymore let's just get it out by November then that's fine I do have grandma being paid now for the next four years just especially with family relationship
Andrew Daniels: ships. I know she says it's not a deal,…
Andrew Daniels: but I think you guys we can make that work if the house numbers work out, you can also start paying off grandma and have her paid off before 2030, too. So, that I just want to make sure that we were cognizant of that and valued her contribution to your lives. …
Miranda Wood: Yeah. Yeah.
Miranda Wood: I had redone the numbers. they should be updated. I thought of with the updated house payment and everything in there. I thought I had already done that…
Andrew Daniels: let me go look at Okay.
Miranda Wood: because when we were talking about buying a house and we had looked at the possible mortgages and everything before we even made an offer, I redid the budget and it came out fine. So yeah,…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah. So, I'll pull those updated numbers, too. And this must be I see.
Miranda Wood: it's in there, but it's not starting till July. So that's why it's looking like it's only $119 or $158 CI.
Andrew Daniels: Yes. Yes. Okay. That's good. So, TW 2259.
Andrew Daniels: So, that is so cool because we've got your current monthly expenses at about 4417. And if we were to go back to the scenario that we were looking at before, it's probably pretty close. It's actually a little bit lower.
Miranda Wood: It's not taking into account our current rent.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah,…
Miranda Wood: So, I was like Andy's gonna be so mad,…
Andrew Daniels: I see that. No, this is great. This is why this works. I'm so excited for you guys. You told me you bought a house and I told Mary I was like I spent so much time on it and I'm gonna have to redo it.
Miranda Wood: but I'm like I did the numbers. I know they work.
Andrew Daniels: No, no, that's totally I'm happy that you can do both because this is great.
Miranda Wood: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: You guys can start building your capital you can have real capital growth and you get a house to live in. it's that balance between you got to have your quality of life but we need to make sure the numbers work. So I love this for you.
Andrew Daniels: This is going to work great. Okay, let me show you what. Okay, this is the exciting piece. So, if we pay off the car immediately and we free up your current cash flow and then you guys kind of change your mindset instead and I'm not allowed to say it's a savings account because But if you make the life insurance policies your capital storage instead of a savings account, a couple of things will happen.  First off, every dollar you run into that warehouse gets credited to you and gets dividends paid out every year that they pay dividends, which has been 125 years straight. whether you take the money out and use it or not. So, we kind of shortcircuit the whole system and you quit having these middlemen take out earnings that you should have. And that's what the banks do. the capital that they get to go to the Federal Reserve and say, "We've got so much in reserve."
00:45:00
Andrew Daniels: They've got hundreds of billions of dollars in life insurance on their executives and…
Andrew Daniels: they're calling that their reserve capital. So they are going straight to the source. There's only two things guaranteed, death and taxes. The banks are going straight to the source of the money. You are now circumventing the banks and going straight to the source of the money because it's the only thing that anybody can count on.
Miranda Wood: It's true.
Andrew Daniels: They cannot count on anybody to keep their word. They can't count on any businesses to be around forever. They can't count on governments to be around forever, The only thing that when it comes down to the money,…
Miranda Wood: No, it's one thing you can bet on.
Andrew Daniels: the only thing that anybody actually trusts is that people will eventually die. And that is what it is.
Andrew Daniels: So if we switch all of this outflow, right, to running it we'll run a portion through the policies and then take back whatever we need to take back out,…
Andrew Daniels: let that 570 grow up for the air conditioner or whatever else. there should be enough capital in there eventually. And with some of the house expenses, maybe it happens in 12 of 26, maybe it doesn't. We're gonna have to see based on your health ratings how quickly we can get it to grow, but we should be able to reach the minimum amount of $25,000 in about 15 months.
Miranda Wood: Okay. Hello. I am my mia.
Miranda Wood: 
Andrew Daniels: What that does is it actually allows you to introduce the third payer into your financial system to the tune of $166 a month.
Andrew Daniels: And that's 25,000 times 8% and I divide that by 12 months. That's $166 a month. in practice, what will happen is we'll take that $25,000 from your policy,…
Andrew Daniels: send it out to the outside payer, and they will pay $166 a month back to your bank account, which you can then send back to the policy. It doesn't seem like a lot now, but I said, "What if we let this thing grow for five years? What if we just did it 26, 27, 28, 29, and 20? You guys are so young. You might decide to keep doing it, But if I had kept going with that strategy, right, you probably wouldn't have believed the numbers that show up when you're 65, right?
Miranda Wood: Okay,…
Miranda Wood: got it.
Andrew Daniels: It's not necessary to do it for your whole life. You just do it for the first five years. I think you guys can figure out what to do with 3.9 million at 65. You won't have trouble spending that money. so the option will always be there. And so basically what I did was I said let's look at the growth. let me see if I can find so I said let's look at the growth of these accounts. we $ clear it If we get $166 added to that account with just the 25, how long before we get an additional $50,000 in the account? look at this. That's less than a year,…
Miranda Wood: Yeah, that's crazy.
Andrew Daniels: basically just reinvesting it.
Miranda Wood: So, that's just putting the $166 a month that they give us and just throwing it right back in.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah.
Miranda Wood: Yeah, just like any other dividend current that I currently have, I've always just had to reinvest.
Andrew Daniels: Put it back in the account and do something with it. So, I'm just kind of following the same track. The difference is this payment is a contractually guaranteed payment that they have to make. If they don't, we're going to what we do is it's called a secured note. We base it on real estate. And here's where I get my second level of guarantees for you guys…
Andrew Daniels: because Somebody says, "Hey, I'll pay you money." Great. That's awesome. My default is I do not believe that you're going to pay me money. What are you going to offer I want you to offer something real. You guys are doing this with your house. There's a buyer and there's a seller anytime you buy a house, but there's also a third party. Who is the third party? The bank.
Miranda Wood: your mortgage.
Miranda Wood: Yeah. They're like your paid
Andrew Daniels: where I'm gonna try and help you guys get to by my goal would be December of 2026. If you have to buy an air conditioner, we got to move that out six months. Okay, so That's totally fine.
Miranda Wood: Get up.
Andrew Daniels: Whether it's 26 27, the strategy still works. It's just on a slightly different time frame. By December of 2026 though, according to this, I want you guys to move into the position of being the banker at the closing table, which means we are going to have a company that says, "Yes, you guys can loan us $25,000. We will pay you $166 a month, and five years from that time, not only will you get the $166 a month, but we will also give you back the $25,000.
00:50:00
Andrew Daniels: If we do not perform on this at any time for any reason, there is a property that you can go to the county recorder and you can take that property,…
Andrew Daniels: sell it off, and make all the money back. It'd be like if you went to Apple and you said, "I want to buy $25,000 worth of Apple stock, but I want a guaranteed interest payment every month, and I want you to take one of your Apple stores, put my name on the title, and I want to be able to go to court and take the title back if you don't pay me.
Miranda Wood: Yeah, definitely.
Andrew Daniels: Apple would never do that, they don't have to, but there are companies…
Miranda Wood: Yeah. Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: who will, and it makes sense for them to do that because commercial loan rates are 19 to 20%. So, you can get 8%, which helps you grow really fast. They can get a deal as long as they offer a piece of property that you can put your name on. And it means you don't have to worry about toilets or renters or anything like that. that's all on them they will figure out that. Our only goal is that they make that payment. and …
Andrew Daniels: they've never missed a payment in 35 years of running this program. So, they have a high financial rating. All the companies I work with have, A+ ratings, highest ratings you can get. okay.
Miranda Wood: I don't know.
Andrew Daniels: So, continuing on with that though, by 12 months later, we can do another 30,000 in. And by 11 months after that, you can do another 35. And by about what,…
Andrew Daniels: 13 months after that, you do another 40. So, We're just kind of keep reinvesting. On that 50,000, in addition to the 166, you'll have 333, right? And then on the 30,000 you'll On the 35,000 you'll have 233.
Miranda Wood: Good girl. That's nice.
Andrew Daniels: And on the 40,000 hold on, you'll have an additional 266.
Andrew Daniels: So, by December of 2030, you guys will have $1,200 a month coming into your financial system that you don't have to show up for.
Miranda Wood: That's nice.
Andrew Daniels: And all and it's kind of a laded strategy.
Andrew Daniels: But $1,200 a month, that's $15,000 a year. It's like you added a minimum wage worker to your household.
Miranda Wood: gig literally.
Miranda Wood: Yeah, basically in five years.
Andrew Daniels: Right. Yeah.
Miranda Wood: Yeah, that's crazy.
Andrew Daniels: And I didn't keep going with it after that. I said, "What if they just take the next five years and run this and then You just keep that $1,200 a month going forever, Just let it keep going.
Miranda Wood: She's okay.
Andrew Daniels: It's fine. Yeah. No, it's good.
Miranda Wood: You are in the way.
Andrew Daniels: Kids are good. I love kids.
Miranda Wood: Yes, you are.
Andrew Daniels: I love two-year-olds. So, if you guys are good, I'm good. don't worry about it. one of the things one when you go through on your portal,…
Miranda Wood: Found her voice.
Andrew Daniels: I'm going to open this new scenario up on your portal so you can see it and kind of play around with it. But what you're going to see is right now in retirement,…
Miranda Wood: Basically, it's like bleeding. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: you have a huge net monthly outflow, part of that though is normal because when you're retired, you're not gonna have income. But one of the things you'll notice is your account will keep growing. your asset balances keep going up higher and higher, And that these are probably a little unrealistic. I don't know that you'll get the $000 $30,000 a month when you're in your 90s. Some of that is those inflation rates, right? We will have corrections on inflation. We will have price things that come down and it gets a little harder.
Andrew Daniels: we go 50 years out into the future, these numbers do get a little crazy and unrealistic. But I just want to point out, I don't see it's a problem for you to have a negative monthly cash flow in retirement. That's something a lot of people struggle with. Just know I have a lot of tools that I engage between 62 and…
Andrew Daniels: 72 that can solve this problem very easily, but I didn't even do it. I was like, "What if we just did five years of optimizing and then nothing else?" We still got you covered.
Miranda Wood: Okay.
Miranda Wood: I like it. Those are nice numbers.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah. Right.
Miranda Wood: And having in five years thinking you have the additional $1,200 like that. Yeah. You're literally adding it's like if Charlotte got a job at the age of seven and all that she makes she works part-time and…
Andrew Daniels: And all of that income,…
Miranda Wood: yeah it's crazy.
00:55:00
Andrew Daniels: all of that income is tracked as taxable income. So, we've made sure that the taxes on that are also covered.
Miranda Wood: Okay, perfect.
Andrew Daniels: So I saw your new numbers in there. I need to pull those in and add those to the scenario. But then I'll share this one with you that has all of my changes and adjustments. One of the first Okay. So, there's that.
Andrew Daniels: I'll get that over to you. Do you guys have any questions about this? This is about as simple as I could make it, but it's a five-year game plan to get you guys really good on track and then we just deal with the stuff that comes up along the way. Yep.
Miranda Wood: Yeah. …
Miranda Wood: you're basically saying kind of first thing first would be Pay off the car by liquidating those retirement funds essentially.
Andrew Daniels: We could move those through a life insurance policy, but it would just be I don't know if that's necessary. it's kind of a bit of administrative effort and…
Andrew Daniels: it could help you, but you guys will have to tell me if you want to do that. it would be 20% more paperwork. So, yeah.
Miranda Wood: Yeah, I think it's okay.
Miranda Wood: I mean, I'm just gonna have to figure out…
Miranda Wood: how to do that because in my head, that's why I asked you. I was like, "Where the hell are you getting $14,000 from?" Because in my head, that's money. It's gone. It's not my money.
Andrew Daniels: Yes. …
Andrew Daniels: don't do it without me because I have a strategy.
Andrew Daniels: If you try to take it straight from them.
Miranda Wood: That's totally fine…
Miranda Wood: because I have no idea how to do it. That's why never…
Andrew Daniels: It's very complicated. I'll help you with that. Yeah.
Miranda Wood: because I was like where is in my head we're broke even though I know we're not but I have that mindset. So I'm just like where is he just pulling this money out of I was very confused.
Andrew Daniels: And I went back and forth. Yeah,…
Miranda Wood: I was like hold up.
Andrew Daniels: I did go back and forth because there is a penalty and…
Andrew Daniels: there is taxes and the benefit of doing it now and getting you in control of that 570 a month where you can put it…
Miranda Wood: Yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: where you want. It outweighs the penalties and the taxes that you might not even owe until next year. that's totally fine. And Earl, with you having a business, you guys should have so many expenses. It's crazy that you have that many expenses. And obviously, you're going to have a home office in your new house that costs a lot of money. And you know what? If you have a home office, you definitely have to decorate it, don't you?
Miranda Wood: And I'm doing yoga, too. So, I set up myself as my own business.
Andrew Daniels: Yes. I love this.
Miranda Wood: And I told him in our new house, I said,…
Miranda Wood: "One is your office and…
Andrew Daniels: Yep.
Miranda Wood: one is my yoga studio." So we take the square footage off of that and any decoration towards that is decoration…
Andrew Daniels: 100%. Yeah.
Miranda Wood: because you have to make it look nice for your teleahalth people. I have to make it look nice as a studio. So I've already planned on we have the receipts on certain things that we've already done.
Andrew Daniels: Great. …
Miranda Wood: Yeah,…
Andrew Daniels: I do have a lady that I hired who does taxes and she does a quarterly check-in for people to make sure that their tax situation is organized along the way. We had a lot of people this year they missed opportunities to rearrange things in 2024.
Andrew Daniels: And so, I got with her, her name is Jasmine, and we kind of said, "Hey, instead of waiting until, February or March to help people file their taxes, we should be checking in with them throughout the year to make sure that they actually have a chance to rearrange and reorganize, hey, have you thought about this home office, this car purchase, what? Let's go through that." So, I can get you guys set up with her so that she can review that stuff with you regularly.
Miranda Wood: that would be helpful. Yeah, because he's like, I have no idea…
Miranda Wood: how to do my taxes. I just save 5% of everything I get and I send it to the government every quarter.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: No, you shouldn't you guys where you're at. So, I assumed I left the tax calculations exactly as they were right in here. If you guys optimize your tax situation, especially with a child,…
Miranda Wood: Exactly.
Andrew Daniels: there should be at least a couple thousand dollar extra per year that you guys are getting that you can run into your system then. So, that too.
Andrew Daniels: But yeah, I did go back and forth on the retirement account and I personally don't like retirement accounts. I think the fox designed the chicken coupe. If there weren't income taxes, we wouldn't need pre pre-tax counts, But clearly we have to have income taxes because that's the way it works. But They left us a way to get around that. and I think with your John Deere account, even if you stay there for a reasonable amount of time, seven to 10 years, you're going to accumulate quite a bit of money in that account. more often than not, it happens 95% of the time, somebody comes to me and they have overfunded their retirement account. There's more money than they actually need for retirement and then they locked that money up where they should have paid off their car 25 years earlier.
01:00:00
Miranda Wood: Yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah,…
Miranda Wood: No, that's fair. I mean, in my head, it's not been there. And I think that 12 was only trying to think that was three not even two and a half years of working. and that wasn't even getting a great return on like they weren't matching.
Andrew Daniels: right. Yeah.
Miranda Wood: I think they only matched one or two% of it. So, at John Deere matching essentially 6% and giving me 300% of 2% it comes out to where I put in six I get essentially 10. I will grow that one a more faster than I ever grew the Mercy one. So,
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah. So, I say the 570 per month is way more valuable to you guys. And I said, I did the target calculation. That's the most valuable number to you guys because it frees up monthly cash flow. And it's not necessarily monthly cash flow to go spend, but it's monthly cash flow.
Andrew Daniels: then you can use to start this system over here. And way it's going to work practically is I want both of you to apply for policies so that we can see what the health ratings are. And I'll do my best. What I do is I optimize the numbers between it.
Miranda Wood: playlist. What?
Andrew Daniels: You Miranda, you might have more on you simply because you're younger and you're female. the rates are better for females because guys die earlier. Yeah. and if you're younger, the rates are going to be better. So, we might wait more of the cash accumulation on your policy. but we still want to be cognizant that because it's still life insurance, too, right? We can't forget that.
Andrew Daniels: So if there is an emergency, if the worst happens to one of you, we want to make sure that the other spouse then has enough funds to continue the game plan at least for a couple of years without the income from the,…
Andrew Daniels: from the past spouse. So that's a smart thing to do. I try to make sure couples are crossinsured for So any other questions? Anything else pop up?
Miranda Wood: Perfect. Okay.
Miranda Wood: I'm trying to think for Charlotte because I had $200 on there for her retirement,…
Miranda Wood: but I'm okay if that goes into an insurance policy for her because She's at a way better deal than we are. to optimize hers as well.
Andrew Daniels: We are right. Yeah.
Miranda Wood: And hers would just be probably for the next until she's at least 16, it would just be whatever dividends Just go right back in. we could optimize her quite a bit. So set her up for that. what are you seeing on that one?
Miranda Wood: Yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Yes and…
Andrew Daniels: I had counted on that because I know we talked about that earlier and I thought why don't we'll take that 200 and just do a oneto one. what would happen there is you guys would be the owners of the policy. So when I think of this, right, all of it is a system, right? I've got some people with 10 policies spread across brothers and cousins and aunts and whatever, right? You don't have to only have a policy on yourself. You can have a policy on anybody, right? I don't like just gratuitously starting up new policies.
Miranda Wood: Thank you.
Andrew Daniels: When we do it, it has to make sense. But here's a couple of things that I'm thinking. I don't know.
Andrew Daniels: waving this letter opener around. here's a couple of things I'm thinking. it's good to build up her policy and as it grows, you can add funds from her policy to the larger notes to create additional third payer and we'll just section off that money to go back into her policy. That's an easy thing to do. where the rubber meets the road for a child is that when you guys pass away, there's going to be a measurable death benefit like millions of dollars. There will be death benefit available.
Miranda Wood: Okay. Thank you.
Andrew Daniels: Where is she going to put that death benefit where it's tax-free and sticks to her for life?
Andrew Daniels: She puts it back into her own policy and it's not going to be large enough to hold all of the death benefit that you guys will have by the time you're 92 or whatever it is, right? But the principle still holds is that you guys can simultaneously fund up her college funding, her getting life started funding her retirement literally. Because if you teach her to use this correctly, she should run money in and out of the system. And every time she makes a per buys a car, buys a house, goes to college,…
Miranda Wood: Mhm. That's it.
Andrew Daniels: if she pays it back everyone else is paying back to Chase Bank, that money all comes back to her. And so by the time you guys are gone, your death benefit will completely fill up and flush up her policy. So she'll have her retirement set in the system that you guys have trained. you guys have all worked together as a family to learn how to use.
01:05:00
Andrew Daniels: And so I don't know what the rates are, but there's one kind of slight challenge with kids. I have less ability to create a maximum and minimum. just because of the way they do underwriting on kids. It's never really been a problem.
Andrew Daniels: I can still do a minimum and a targeted amount, but the amount that goes in on top is probably going to be very limited. you won't be able to do much more than $200 a month for her.
Miranda Wood: And that's okay.
Miranda Wood: I mean, I think starting her out at $200 a month as a two-year-old and…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah.
Miranda Wood: having it grow, I think she'll have sufficient by the time that she actually needs it or gets where it could get higher,…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. The general rule of thumb when I'm designing these policies is that you should have around as much cash and…
Miranda Wood: ?
Andrew Daniels: with kids it actually happens a little bit quicker but this is the most conservative worst case scenario estimate right?
Andrew Daniels: I love underpromising and overd delivering, right? So, I'll just tell you that I love it. So, the longest, right, 10 years, the amount you put in over a 10-year period the cash should equal that, So, if you're doing $2,400 a year, in 10 years, there should be 24,000. In another 10 years, it'll be even faster than that. It'll be 60,000, right? It's going to go nuts after the initial period. The next 10 years, you keep doing 2400. and I'll have to do the numbers on this, she should have around 50 to 50 to $60,000 available as a young adult getting started, which she can use it for college, books, cars, moving expenses, whatever. And I think as a family, you guys should have your eye on setting the culture with her, hey, we are setting this up for you, but you're going to have to learn how to use it responsibly. When you take money out, you need to have a plan to put it back in.
Andrew Daniels: It doesn't have to go in four months. if you've got a car for $25,000, do a four-year loan and pay yourself back a reasonable amount, whatever you can afford. As long as there's some kind of plan and you can teach them to do that, your family then becomes the Chase Bank. And all of the stuff that all of us have been trained to go get loans for go,…
Andrew Daniels: all that money goes back into your family And then you guys get to use it for retirement, for college, for he gets to use it once you guys are gone. And I really like this system and I'm excited that you guys want to do it because I think every young family should do it.
Miranda Wood: No, I mean I think just it's going to help us out even just thinking that fiveyear plan is a lot better than my initial five-year plan of …
Andrew Daniels: Nothing.
Miranda Wood: initially it's like, okay, in two years we'll have our emergency savings, we'll have that paid off, we'll have this paid off, so we'll have a lot more cash flow. And so, I think just being able to be in five years, we'll essentially have another kind of income coming in that we essentially kind of paid for ourselves, but didn't have to do a lot of work for is nice.
Andrew Daniels: And it's Yeah.
Miranda Wood: It's very comforting.
Andrew Daniels: And I think you had a lot of pieces, I don't want you to be what I have was terrible." It wasn't. there's no way you guys would be where you're at now without the kinds of smart things you've already done. Right. My job is to just kind of look at everything and go, "How can we optimize this?" even like giving you permission and then helping you get the money out of the Mercy account. Let's get that car loan taken care of.
Andrew Daniels: I could see it on your face last time we talked when you were talking about the car loan.
Andrew Daniels: The car loan and the payment to Ashley were like those are the ones that are getting it.
Miranda Wood: Yeah. I mean,…
Miranda Wood: it's almost $1,000 a month. it's just irritating.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yep. Yeah. And irritating…
Miranda Wood: Which I mean, yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: because of the situation, too. it's some third party bank that you can't like you're just a number. it's like a relationship that didn't go so well and we're going out now. Let's get it taken care of and…
Miranda Wood: She hired you,…
Andrew Daniels: get you out of that.
Miranda Wood: promised you a lot, and then didn't deliver and then now is paying you to get out of it because she didn't deliver. And it's like, okay.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: I mean that stuff happens. And so one of the things that you guys will have that I think what I see helps people the most is this idea of having flexibility with those kinds of things. There will be times where we'll go through these analyzers and I'll say, "Guys, it's time for you to start looking for that AC. We planned for this. Let's do it and make it happen."
Andrew Daniels: and you're going to have a payment for it, but that payment's going to go right back into your pocket.
Miranda Wood: Even when I move money from our bills savings to our emergency savings,…
Andrew Daniels: So, when you're making a payment on something that is going back to a spot you control, you're like, "Woohoo! I get to make my AC payment today." Because it just go right back to your pocket.
Miranda Wood: I'm like, man, that looks sad, but I'm like, it's still mine.
01:10:00
Andrew Daniels: Still yours.
Miranda Wood: It's just Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: You still control it. So, yeah. Okay. I think
Andrew Daniels: Any other questions? Okay, I am recording this so I'll send it to you guys so you can review it. I will update the retirement analyzer. And then the next thing I think we should do is I want to get an underwriting rating from a company for both of you so I can actually plug in the actual numbers and see what that looks like. any major health issues for either of you?
Miranda Wood: I don't think so.
Miranda Wood: I'm obese.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. …
Miranda Wood: That's a health issue.
Andrew Daniels: I mean, yeah, what I would do, they're probably going to ask you for that's common. I don't know that that's ever, prevent anybody from getting life insurance. What they're concerned about is if you've had major weight loss or weight gain in the last 12 months. If it's been significant, that's where they get concerned. But if it's been about the same,…
Miranda Wood: Yeah. Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: then it should be fine.
Andrew Daniels: what I'll do is I will send you guys the applications because we're not getting a policy right now. This is just a rating. And I do it this way because it's free because they let me do it. And if we can do stuff that's no obligation to either of us. That leaves us more options, I don't want to commit to something. We don't know what the rate's going to be. So, there's going to be a lot of blanks on it. That's okay. Just skip over the stuff that you're not allowed. I have it set up so that only the fields are available that you need to fill out. and we'll get a request. We'll get a rating. And what that involves, they'll probably have you do a paramed exam, which is basically exam one, you can call them up and have a nurse come to your house. They'll take your weight, your height, they'll ask you about your family history and all that stuff. we get that done. They come back to us and it takes six weeks. So, this is not a fast process.
Andrew Daniels: We won't have answers on this yet,…
Miranda Wood: Where did it go?
Andrew Daniels: which is also why I think we should work on paying your car loan off first without worrying about running money through. Let's get that taken care of because that 570 a month, that adds up pretty quick. And I'd rather it add up in your pockets than someone else's. So, what they'll do is they'll get back to us and they'll say, "Okay, congratulations. You guys are so healthy. You're approved. You can get $2 and half million dollars of insurance and you could pay $48,000 a month for that." and we go, "Haha, nice one. Thanks so much for the rating. This is what we actually want. It's going to be $200 a month here. It'll be $600 a month, whatever." As long as we come back with a real policy request that is underneath what they approved, they won't ask any more questions. So, that's also…
Miranda Wood: Okay. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: why I like to do it because then we get a chance to look at real numbers before we ever make a decision.
Miranda Wood: Yeah. Where we like commit and…
Miranda Wood: be like, "Yeah, no, can't afford that.
Andrew Daniels: Yes. Yep.
Andrew Daniels: And if we don't like the rating that they give us, we can take all your exams and…
Andrew Daniels: stuff and just do another company without having to go through the exams again.
Miranda Wood: Okay. Yeah,…
Andrew Daniels: So yeah, I'll send those out to you. and then as you complete them, just finish them up, I'll do one for both of you. I have Earl's email address. tmnbgmail.com. Wait,…
Miranda Wood: 
Miranda Wood: that's right. Yeah. No,…
Andrew Daniels: is that like secret code?
Miranda Wood: it's his initials and my old initials. So, yes,…
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Okay. you're just trying to Yeah.
Miranda Wood: secret code. Definitely. Definitely.
Andrew Daniels: So, I'll send each of you a request individually. and then if you have any questions or something, just text me and I'll be available.
Andrew Daniels: But as for now, we need to wait for those ratings to come in to really execute the next stage of the plan.
Andrew Daniels: And then I can send you some instructions on how to get that money transferred for Mercy. What you're going to want to do is you're going to want to open a new private self-directed custodial account and have Mercy transfer tax-free. It's called a rollover. You want to roll it over into that personal account. actually, hold on.
Miranda Wood: I think I do have a personal account with Fidelity.
Andrew Daniels: Yes, I was going to say you already have one, so we don't need to open one up.
Andrew Daniels: Yes, there we go. Okay, let's save on the cost here.
Miranda Wood: I'll have to look.
Miranda Wood: But I'm pretty sure I had done that because the Fidelity guy was like because I was like, "How if I wanted to control this myself, what do I do?" And he goes, "You'll have to open up your own." And I Okay.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. …
Miranda Wood: So, I think there's $400 or something in it. it's Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: is the Mercy Okay, so that must be where the $400 with Fidelity came from.
Miranda Wood: Yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Got it.
Miranda Wood: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: Got it. Okay.
Andrew Daniels: So, this is really easy. Benefits administrators are required to withhold taxes if you make a withdrawal from them directly. They are not required if it's a rollover and it's a private custodian. So, the first move for you would be to take that 401k at Mercy and roll it over to Fidelity, if that makes sense.
01:15:00
Miranda Wood: Yeah. Roll a personal fidelity.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Miranda Wood: Yeah. I say it's all on my fidelity dashboard.
Andrew Daniels: When do you close?
Miranda Wood: 
Miranda Wood: So you just have to May 29th.
Andrew Daniels: When do you close on the house?
Miranda Wood: A month from now.
Andrew Daniels: Have you already paid May's car payment, the 570 or the 470? Yeah.
Miranda Wood: That goes out on It's May 7th. I don't know how long that takes to do anything. No, cuz the car's on me.
Andrew Daniels: One of the things and did the mortgage broker that you're working with do they have any opinions on the car loan?
Miranda Wood: Carlin's on in his name, not mine.
Andrew Daniels: And he's not going to be part of the mortgage.
Miranda Wood: No, that's…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Miranda Wood: how we did it. He has better credit than I do. I have better credit. and the only loans that show on me are my student loans. So, my debt to income ratio is really good. and…
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Yeah.
Miranda Wood: And he has a car loan and all of his giant is not good. And his income is not great. So, he's not on house loan,…
Andrew Daniels: Right. Right. Right. one of the things that we want to watch out for is…
Miranda Wood: just me. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: if you liquidate the 401k through Fidelity, right?
Andrew Daniels: If additional cash hits your accounts while you're wrapping up the loan,…
Andrew Daniels: that's going to cause a challenge. So, I almost want to say wait to do the car loan one more month until the house closes. In fact, that's probably the best option. I mean, I know it's one more pay, but 570 is not going to be a big deal. Would it be a problem to say wait on this? just wait to do the money moving until the loan closes.
Miranda Wood: Wait. No,…
Miranda Wood: that's fine.
Andrew Daniels: I think Yeah.
Miranda Wood: Yeah, because the loan is through Rocket Mortgage and so they know the money is coming from Rocket Money and so they can see that. So, they would be like,…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yes.
Miranda Wood: "Why are you having another 12 grand in here that we didn't account for?" Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: It will throw them into a tizzy.
Miranda Wood: Yeah. Yeah. Makes sense. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: All right.
Andrew Daniels: Good news is we have our game plan together and we really can't do much until we get the life insurance rating anyways. So there's no more rush for us to do much.
Andrew Daniels: I would say wait until that loan closes to deal with the mercy thing and then you'll know when you're moving into your house your car payment's gone. That we're going to do both those at the same time.
Miranda Wood: Yeah. Yeah.
Miranda Wood: No, that would be good. Yeah, because I can still at least roll it over to my own though, Okay.
Andrew Daniels: Yes. Yep. You can do that part for and then hopefully the life insurance doesn't take six or eight weeks. Hopefully it's pretty easy. You guys are young. You don't have health issues. Should be pretty quick. So, in that meantime, this is kind of lining up perfectly because We can't rush the life insurance company. We want them to take their time because their dividend is directly related to how good they do estimating their costs with somebody.
Miranda Wood: Okay, works for me.
Andrew Daniels: So, we're okay with them taking a minute to evaluate all the stuff and then we can just kind of set maybe June 1st for where do we organize all this stuff once we get the numbers back. So, yep. We'll get the applications in. You can do the Mercy thing because you've done rollovers before and you already have a self-directed with Fidelity. So, yeah. Perfect. I'll send you guys some notes over emails just to kind of confirm what the major action items are and then if you have any questions, feel free to reach out or whatnot. But yeah, it could take a while to get everything kind of set up. But once we have it done, it'll be set it and forget it. And then I do kind of monitor your stuff and as things kind of progress, I'll either reach out every six months and I'll say, "Hey, it's time for us to check in. Is everything still going the way it's supposed to? What do we need to rearrange? Did you buy another house?"
Andrew Daniels: Or I'll kind of call you up "Hey, you've got enough money. We can do the next step." " let's talk about that and I'll remind you what it looks like." So, yeah. Any other questions?
Miranda Wood: The only question I have is…
Miranda Wood: what do you get out of this? what's your cut?
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. So, I don't charge fees to people personally, the way I have it set up is when we decide to go with a product or a strategy, whatever company offers the highest rate, I just click a button. I say, "Okay, Who is the strongest rated company? Who can give us the most money for…
Miranda Wood: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: what we're trying to do? which companies make sense for moving money in and out."
Andrew Daniels: So once I figure all that out, the companies then pay me a commission, but it does not come out of your money. That's the really big piece of it. So, for example, if we're looking at this 25,000 that we would do and I love this. This is the best way to do it because everybody wins. So, if we looked at this we look at this 25,000 that we're planning on, right?  So, you guys have a $25,000 asset. You will get $166 a month. I get a 6% commission as it's almost like a real estate deal, But here's what's cool. The company has to pay that. You guys still get your 25,000 at the end. You still get your interest payments every month. I don't get any interest payments. It's not like I'm skimming something off the top or if the deal is 8%,'s 8%. It all goes to you. Same thing with all of these.
01:20:00
Andrew Daniels: And the life insurance works similarly. I get way less on the life insurance because I'm not trying to do death benefit for you Where that comes back for me is that the benefit of this system is you guys are going to generate a whole bunch of cash that I'm hoping we can go send out to work for you. And I'll always do that deal with you. I won't charge you, it's not like I'm going to charge you monthly for this part of things. the tax prep stuff, I think we're going to do a monthly service fee on that, but the benefit on that is we won't charge to do taxes at the end of the year. So, if you guys do a…
Andrew Daniels: if you want to do a deal with Jasmine, she can set you up on a monthly amount. We'll check in with you four times a year. If you do all the check-ins, we should have everything we already need to just do your taxes automatically. that should cover it.
Miranda Wood: Yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: And then you won't have to pay to have your taxes done.
Andrew Daniels: So yeah, for this part of it though, I like it because the companies pay me and it doesn't have to come out of your pocket. When we look at these numbers, these are all inclusive. it's like buying a TV off the shelf. You're not worried if the warehouse worker gets paid. You just go buy the TV.
Miranda Wood: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: And then if my hope is this, and this has happened pretty regularly, so I know it will in five years. You guys are so over the top excited with what we've been able to do. You tell all your friends about me and go, "You have to work with Andy." Yeah.
Miranda Wood: I'm already thinking about sending somebody your way.
Andrew Daniels: And I got here's what I'll tell people because people are like, " I referred so and they just don't seem interested." so what? I will help anybody who wants to come and ask me for help, right? But…
Andrew Daniels: if your friends don't get it, I'm not worried about that.
Andrew Daniels: That's more time that my brain gets to spend on your situation. And the gap will show, right? You guys start doing this, you're gonna have a noticeable gap in lifestyle from where all your peers are at right now. And some of them will come and they'll call me at 40. Some of them will call me at 55.
Miranda Wood: There you go.
Andrew Daniels: Everybody's got their own journey. So, I'll put my full brain on your guys' stuff for as long as you need me. All right.
Miranda Wood: Cool. Thanks.
Miranda Wood: Charger.
Andrew Daniels: We got our game plan, right? Yep.
Miranda Wood: Yep. Yeah,…
Andrew Daniels: We have lots to do, but we can't do any of it fast.
Miranda Wood: that's okay. I just hurry up and wait. Okay,…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. all if you guys have questions or something, I'll put together an email and I'll send you the recording. So, if anything pops up you got questions on, just let me know.
Miranda Wood: sounds Perfect. Thank you.
Andrew Daniels: All right. You guys have a great afternoon. Bye.

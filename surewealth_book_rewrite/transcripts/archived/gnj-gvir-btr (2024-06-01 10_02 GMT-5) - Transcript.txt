Andrew Daniels: Your premium is twenty five hundred dollars a month or something. it's still high but your HomePath is covering up to the amount of that that you were paying out of pocket.
pat Petrakis: right most of
Andrew Daniels: So your other policies like five hundred dollars out of pocket. So you're still $500 out of pocket for that.
pat Petrakis: right right
Andrew Daniels: But at the age of your policy it should be old enough no yours was the one that was really good it turned over in two years.
pat Petrakis: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: I've never seen it in my life. So crazy and I'm pulling it up here. yeah, so the way I wrote it was kind of the original game plan was we take that $500 that you're already spending to Ohio National. We redirect that to Lafayette and then we kind of stacked on top of that with the income from home path. And that's…
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: where yours is getting funded now. There it…
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: Found it. Now I got pulled up. And that amount is drum roll, please. 2055 but there's not a lot of room left in your policy either we can't fill it up and…
pat Petrakis: Yeah.
pat Petrakis: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: there's not ensues because we pretty much had the exact amount that we knew that was going to go in there. I didn't create room for that.
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: But that is what it is. So yours is full and I mean it's just kind of chugging along pretty happily you've got $15,000 available right now. so
pat Petrakis: In August, I'm gonna pay off one of the other cars and then I'm gonna as you said Cascade or whatever that term is I take that payment towards the other part make sure I'll pay off the other car.
Andrew Daniels: yes waterfall. Yeah. right
pat Petrakis: wonderful, right So that's kind of my plan on so I mean that's a lot of money but soon is accumulating even more. So the question I have is I've got a lot of money not a I have an embarrassingly low amount of money. for retirement But I have the government pension that I'm gonna have I have a couple of annuities I have.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: So that's the tsp.
pat Petrakis: The tsp. That was what I took money out of so I have my tsp,…
Andrew Daniels: We already did.
pat Petrakis: but I also have a pension. Yeah. So…
Andrew Daniels: yes, okay. Right, right.
pat Petrakis: but it doesn't maintain my luxurious lifestyle.
Andrew Daniels: Here's the cool thing. Let's see. I'm gonna call the June update so that we can do a new scenario.
pat Petrakis: Okay, right.
Andrew Daniels: I do so the overall strategy is accumulate as much as you can now you're working.
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: When you stop working. I do have other strategies and play and you've already kind of started with those. So that's partly what we did with that a theme annuity. Now that has a 12% rollup every year. I don't know if you remember that.
pat Petrakis: Yes, I do.
pat Petrakis: That's why I like it.
Andrew Daniels: Right, there's two accounts.
Andrew Daniels: There's the account value that's kind of like spikes accounts. It's kind of like a brokerage account except for you can never lose money. You only gain but you only get half the game though.
pat Petrakis: right right
Andrew Daniels: They're gonna limit your gain, but you can never lose. There's that roll up bonus account. And that bonus account got 30% up front and it earns 12% every year. Whichever account is higher when you want to take income you get to take income based on the higher account. here's the cool part about it the older you get the withdrawal from that account.
pat Petrakis: 
pat Petrakis: But at some point don't I have to withdraw from it? …
Andrew Daniels: No.
pat Petrakis: there's no like hey, you have to have required distribution.
Andrew Daniels: No. Was that an IRA?
pat Petrakis: It might be.
Andrew Daniels: So here's the thing with the annuities. the minimum distribution always work out. They will always structure it to make sure that it will work out. So whatever it…
pat Petrakis: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, if it was that I wasn't an IRA we did too. We did a Roth and a traditional. So with the Roth you won't have any required with the traditional.
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: There is a report required minimum distribution. The company will make sure that that happens no matter what So worst case scenario though.
pat Petrakis: Okay, yeah.
Andrew Daniels: The rmd age is 72. Worst case scenario.
pat Petrakis: 
Andrew Daniels: You forced to take income at 72. I mean gosh that's what 10 years away. Yeah, and…
pat Petrakis: Yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: at 72 the withdrawal rates gonna be seven or eight percent. And so yeah.
pat Petrakis: Right, but I also didn't put that much in there. So.
Andrew Daniels: It doesn't matter because think about this. I mean it does but somebody that wants to get so let's say there's a hundred thousand dollars just to keep it simple. somebody else that's Not to be bad, but playing the stock market game that's got exposure to this and that they can only take out Adam at most three or…
00:05:00
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: four percent to keep that fund alive.
pat Petrakis: That's true.
pat Petrakis: That is true.
Andrew Daniels: So if you have a hundred thousand dollars and…
Andrew Daniels: they have $100,000. They can only take four percent you get to take eight percent. And yours is guaranteed for life. So with the same amount of assets that you've built up you're taking twice as much money. That we're playing both sides of the equation.
pat Petrakis: right, and that's right, right.
Andrew Daniels: You can do it on the other side too. So yes, I agree that it feels like you might not have enough saved up but that's really only a problem. If you need the whole million dollars the day you retire. we want to look at is how do we get you income? That's kind of last and some months you might spend all the income other months, you might not and you'll just let it build up and what I see with people is,
Andrew Daniels: What I mean, I've got people my oldest client is 97 and by that time she's constantly. I got 97,000 my bank account. I'm like Marie. You gotta do something with that. Don't just leave it your bank account.
pat Petrakis: Right, right.
Andrew Daniels: Right or that generally tends to happen is if we solve the income piece first out of that you get liquidity and people do that accumulation and when they get to retirement, they never switch their mindset and they keep trying to grow their Capital base really if they've worked on their income and they got that the stable foundation for the income. You won't have to worry about liquidity. You're not gonna buy a new car every year. You're not gonna redo a pool every year,…
pat Petrakis: No God,…
Andrew Daniels: right? Yeah.
pat Petrakis: no I mean I do live with Gene this kid just kidding.
Andrew Daniels: So if I get both of you set up with something like this,…
pat Petrakis: He just let go the first
Andrew Daniels: maybe there'll be enough income to cover her pet projects.
pat Petrakis: she's taking her money and she wants to redo the yard this year and to tell you the truth the grass looks pretty nice, but there are some big potholes, just knowing over …
Andrew Daniels: 
pat Petrakis: where we took out The Cottonwood tree.
Andrew Daniels: the trees Yeah.
pat Petrakis: I mean the roots are. Thinking and…
Andrew Daniels: And I'll bet yeah,…
pat Petrakis: it is what?
Andrew Daniels: they're all degrading.
Andrew Daniels: So now it's getting yeah. Yeah.
pat Petrakis: Right, right.
pat Petrakis: But whatever with that's cheese thing.
Andrew Daniels: I know a sprinkler guy to get help with some Landscaping.
pat Petrakis: Okay, then let's moving on. That's James money.
Andrew Daniels: So no that I…
pat Petrakis: but right
Andrew Daniels: that's the whole goal that I'm kind of pushing you towards as you kind of inch closer to that two-year Mark that we talked about is okay,…
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: whatever we can accumulate with now, let's do that. But the idea is we're gonna chunk off pieces of income over after you get to retirement. Okay, what do we need to get income now?
pat Petrakis: I think so. I had been thinking about retiring and January 2025 and then I thought no I'll do it 2026 and then I think we're gonna do is actually retire in January of 2027. So I will be about 66 I'll be 65 and a half which doesn't quite get me Social Security…
Andrew Daniels: right
pat Petrakis: and Though can be on my insurance…
Andrew Daniels: John Right,…
pat Petrakis: until he's 26 and that'll be at age 26, so.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, so you get to keep going Insurance somebody else's insurance, basically. Yeah,…
pat Petrakis: Exactly. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: yeah, that makes sense. it gives you some more time too. I know you've got an aggressive pay down on the debts to get those paid down and…
pat Petrakis: Mm-hmm
Andrew Daniels: then have a couple of months of just building up without having to pay out on all that so much. Yeah.
pat Petrakis: right right
Andrew Daniels: Okay, so I don't actually have anything in here for the pension. Do you have a calculation on that?
pat Petrakis: Let's I think I may have emailed it to myself but See what I have here. let's get to my email.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, and you can flip off the screen that we're on. Yeah, that's actually gonna be a big help and…
pat Petrakis: That would be
Andrew Daniels: I have your social security benefit 2800 a month that seems really low.
pat Petrakis: Yeah, no, but it's right. Yeah, unfortunately.
Andrew Daniels: It is. Really? Okay.
pat Petrakis: Yeah. I mean isn't that crazy, but you know what, I mean, so that's what happens with Social Security.
pat Petrakis: You pay in a whole boatload of money and it'll get much out which is…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
pat Petrakis: that's why people are like, you can't do means based.
00:10:00
pat Petrakis: a distribution Let's see.
pat Petrakis: no. You have time for me to boot up my work computer.
Andrew Daniels: it's also because it's pay as you go so the money. Yeah. yeah. No, I've got time blocked out. I just want to get that because when we start talking about when am I going to retire we want to make sure we follow the funds and look at it all the way out.
pat Petrakis: I feel like there's not very much. income on a pension they take a lot out, but let's see if I can actually put this up or if I let it go to sleep too, Mom.
Andrew Daniels: So I sunseted the side job. We had that going 1100 dollars a month coming in until August of 25. Is that still true? Okay.
pat Petrakis: Yes.
Andrew Daniels: don't know about that. beats his wedding is done. So that was in 23.
Andrew Daniels: I was just checking over some of the stuff that we had.
Andrew Daniels: Do you have your okay, and then if you're getting into the government system, the last balance I had on your tsp was 48,000 that was about six months ago. I guessing it's grown since then, hopefully.
pat Petrakis: It took some of it out, but hang on just a second. I think it has grown. So I changed so my gosh,…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
pat Petrakis: my work computer. …
Andrew Daniels: No worries.
pat Petrakis: so I think okay so my tsp. I moved into those two annuities. And I think I left about $10,000.
Andrew Daniels: That's right. That's what we need.
pat Petrakis: But I think I'm up to about 21,000 or something like that.
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
pat Petrakis: I'll open that up here in just a minute, but there's a government calculator for …
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
pat Petrakis: what do you have in retirement from us? Right
Andrew Daniels: For retention. Yeah. Yeah. I actually just went through that with a teacher. She's got about 18 years left and we were looking at sion. The teacher's pension is great. But then she has nothing else outside of that and I'm like guys you're like 38 if you do it, right you guys need to save some money here, but you got an opportunity.
pat Petrakis: right Right, right, there's time but don't waste it.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. I kind of had to have that conversation. I was like don't waste the time you have because good that you're coming to me at 38 instead of 68.
pat Petrakis: right
pat Petrakis: Say I keep telling Bell and I don't know what beats and broker doing. I know they're trying to. make as much money as they can.
Andrew Daniels: Everything I think they're being real smart. they've got a really good foundation. And that's just what I tell them you guys have a great foundation and I tried to slow down their urgency about everything my guys just enjoy…
pat Petrakis: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: what you have right now because like you you don't need to get into the thick of life right away.
pat Petrakis: Okay. No.
pat Petrakis: they
pat Petrakis: are they want to have a kid right, but I hope they delay a little bit. just child care costs,…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. my God.
pat Petrakis: they'll either pay for childcare or they'll
pat Petrakis: and keep their current jobs or one of them will step back to it every part-time or something.
Andrew Daniels: I just doable with one when you start getting more than one though. Holy cow that cost a child care will eat up that other income so fast.
pat Petrakis: It's crazy. it's not right. but you…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
pat Petrakis: what? Are you gonna do? Yeah Have other taxpayers pay for that too.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
pat Petrakis: but
Andrew Daniels: I mean it during covid and Okay, so I'm looking at your notes too…
pat Petrakis: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: because I just want to make sure we have track of all the ones that we've got in there. There's the two of five. and then
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, this is why I like to do this too. I mean, that we can get a good look at the forecast too and…
pat Petrakis: review these things but
Andrew Daniels: make sure it's 2026 gonna be the right spot. I don't know. We need to look at the numbers.
pat Petrakis: right Yeah. So my farm is down to 57,000 boy that goes awful slow getting rid of that. But Come on.
Andrew Daniels: 57 that's pretty good. It was 70 the last time we cried. okay,…
pat Petrakis: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: so I got any of the cars paid off we got the Honda the Chrysler the Santa Fe and the Kia. Woo. All right.
00:15:00
pat Petrakis: The key is paid off. Yeah, it's all paid off the Honda. That's the one I'm going to pay. I'm trying to decide so I won't have quite enough money to pay off the stupid Santa Fe because
pat Petrakis: cuz it's too much of a car. I should not have bought that car. so I have
Andrew Daniels: So that's 1769 and Auto Loan, but that's down now. Are you applying the difference of the Payment to the other loans…
pat Petrakis: yes.
Andrew Daniels: then now.
pat Petrakis: And I owe.
Andrew Daniels: great.
pat Petrakis: Let's see here. Is my balance?
pat Petrakis: Okay, I owe 19,000 on the Honda. And 27,000 on the Santa Fe. so I'll probably
Andrew Daniels: That's great that NFA was at 34 last time six months ago. Is that 34? That's good.
pat Petrakis: Yeah, I'm working on it.
Andrew Daniels: That's good.
pat Petrakis: I'm putting the extra money into that one because it's got the higher interest rate. Which is not even that Hive think about it.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
pat Petrakis: And then the Chrysler I owe 13,000, but it's only gonna it.
Andrew Daniels: Holy cow. That was at 24 last time. This is great progress.
pat Petrakis: No. No the Chrysler was at 16 or 17, and…
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
pat Petrakis: but it's got an interest rate of 2.9. So I feel like I should pay towards the Santa Fe first. but
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. I mean, it's a slight difference but you're saving some cash by doing the Santa Fe. the only consideration is this. You've got 13,000 left on the Chrysler. and that
pat Petrakis: I could pay it off and put a chunk towards the something.
Andrew Daniels: It's three.
Andrew Daniels: It's 342 a month. Right? Why don't we take a policy loan?
pat Petrakis: Yeah, right.
Andrew Daniels: Pay off the Chrysler this week and start putting that other 342 a month The Santa Fe You're putting 342. Plus 337 from the Kia now, you've got 679 plus the 730. You're taking it down by 1400 dollars a month.
pat Petrakis: Yeah, and that's a good idea. I should do That I'm gonna plan on that. Did you know I'm going to Pittsburgh with Kathy?
Andrew Daniels: no, I did not. Why was that?
pat Petrakis: she is getting some sort of award and for
Andrew Daniels: 
Andrew Daniels: she went to school out there didn't she?
pat Petrakis: No, no that shoot the Pittsburgh, Kansas for school. No, she is getting an award through the association of manufacturing Engineers for teaching something or other right? Yeah. we had to actually call and…
Andrew Daniels: Really? All right, okay.
pat Petrakis: check on that before we bought tickets, but
Andrew Daniels: To make sure that it's not pay us $10,000 and will promote you.
pat Petrakis: I'm not saying that that's not what they did. but anyway,…
Andrew Daniels: right right
pat Petrakis: but no So I'm flying out there. I'll be back on Tuesday, and then I'll …
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
pat Petrakis: come on. Where is my?
Andrew Daniels: Pat, here's another thing I see over here. You've got this Parent PLUS Loan out at seven seven point two percent.
pat Petrakis: Yeah. Yeah, that's the other thing. I think I owe about twelve thousand dollars on that so I could pay that out.
Andrew Daniels: We should pay that off next because that's the highest interest rate.
pat Petrakis: Okay, they're gonna offer.
Andrew Daniels: You've got out of all of these. that one
pat Petrakis: I'm telling you that freaking student loan. All I can say is Don't ever take out a student loan.
Andrew Daniels: no, I tell everyone Parent Plus Loans do not do parent plus if you can help it.
pat Petrakis: Yeah, I miss managed the money that the kids got from Greg's death. And I should have been aggressing aggressively investing because he died in 2008, right and…
Andrew Daniels: yeah, and
pat Petrakis: then the benefits started coming in and the stock market was going crazy. I could have had a million dollars. I don't know but
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, that's the thing about I mean you never know when the bottom is at that time. We didn't know if it was gonna be stable. I mean it took 10 years for people to realize this is not going away and…
pat Petrakis: right
pat Petrakis: they kept Right,…
Andrew Daniels: then it did go away very quickly.
pat Petrakis: they kept.
pat Petrakis: Talking about a shaped recession, right and…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
pat Petrakis: and that me I'm a frightened investor. so my retirement, let me see if I can I'm on this site and We get to it here. so
00:20:00
pat Petrakis: currently eligible and no only if I'm disabled.
pat Petrakis: my This should be this hard, okay. Let's talk about this. I want to calculate.
pat Petrakis: So they have a calculator,…
Andrew Daniels: the pension tool
pat Petrakis: but where is it? Why can't I retirement calculator?
pat Petrakis: benefit tight it is the Voluntary first eligible would be June 1st of 2024.
Andrew Daniels: today
pat Petrakis: right, but my data retirement I'm going to put and…
Andrew Daniels: he said January of 26.
pat Petrakis: Too.
pat Petrakis: Yeah Let's say 2027.
Andrew Daniels: or 20 27 yeah.
pat Petrakis: So My salary projection I'll use my current salary. I know there's some increases that might be something that much. I have a final sick leave. We'll be 781 hours if I don't like Survivor full benefit half benefit
pat Petrakis: I'll put full benefits
Andrew Daniels: Just do the full for now. Yeah.
pat Petrakis: Coverage I'm not going to take any. Let's see. Blue Cross I went Insurance. I'll have Medicare.
pat Petrakis: I'll just cancel coverage.
Andrew Daniels: Although allow you to stay on their insurance. That's pretty sweet.
pat Petrakis: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, and there's a whole and I think we'll have to do that when you get closer to 65 off to be that enrollment
pat Petrakis: right What will I do a single? Filing separately as taxes or head of household. I won't have any kids in the house.
Andrew Daniels: You'll just be single, right?
pat Petrakis: That's terrible. That's a lot of taxable annual pay from all jobs. No. I'm not gonna have any. if you responsive other pensions annuities that pay less annually than this one then end of the total annual taxable payments from such pensions.
Andrew Daniels: You don't have any others. Yeah.
pat Petrakis: I'm gonna say no. number qualified children other dependents other credits tax credits I don't have any other income deductions actually, who knows? That's true.
Andrew Daniels: Are they trying to get?
pat Petrakis: That's two years from now.
Andrew Daniels: Are they trying to give you an after-tax number?
pat Petrakis: Yeah, okay, so for my first retirement, my net monthly annuity will be considering taxes. Was the gross monthly annuity would be 3,089 and the net would be 2,884.
Andrew Daniels: I'm gonna put 30 89 because we're calculating the taxes on our own based on everything else you've got going on.
pat Petrakis: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: So, yeah, so 3089. That's the number we wanted. Okay.
pat Petrakis: So that's furs. And then let's see. Let's go.
Andrew Daniels: yeah, that helps the cause a lot. For sure.
pat Petrakis: and then my Thrift Savings Plan, let me just get into that.
pat Petrakis: I currently have. project my TSA
Andrew Daniels: and there's actually two separate components to that one is the Roth and the others the
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: It only gives me an option for one. the taxes must be calculated when you take it out. They'll track them and…
pat Petrakis: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: the other stuff separately.
pat Petrakis: How come I can't?
Andrew Daniels: I see what happened here. There it is. I already had it loaded up. That's why it wouldn't let me do a second one. So yeah, we've got about 10 and 1 and 11 in the other. for a total about 21 on those tsps
pat Petrakis: why is this so difficult? So, I don't know. What's happening here. my project is Project tsp account.
pat Petrakis: but I'm on my TSA, but it doesn't have how much do I have in there? but I probably have to go to it.
00:25:00
Andrew Daniels: 
pat Petrakis: But I think at Google tsp because The little platform that they have doesn't link it. Is that crazy or what?
Andrew Daniels: no, it's the government. That makes sense. They would just build completely separate systems that will never be able to talk to each other.
pat Petrakis: No, but I mean right anyway.
Andrew Daniels: But you absolutely need to have information from both to get the full picture. That's perfect.
pat Petrakis: exactly and why can't I log in with my
Andrew Daniels: make sure the tea is the right tsp website and…
pat Petrakis: yeah, it is…
Andrew Daniels: it's not everyone say
pat Petrakis: but of course, they Take it easy.
pat Petrakis: Honestly, honestly, honestly, why?
Andrew Daniels: while you're doing that. I'm gonna add the information from your annuities in here so we can see that.
pat Petrakis: Okay, right, okay.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, I think this will help you, even just seeing all the numbers and seeing how it tracks through. I think it'll be really good for you to see that it is helpful when we get everything down and…
pat Petrakis: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: then we can see this is where it's tracking. This is how it's working. Think that'll be good.
pat Petrakis: Right, okay. there we go. what my patches of course I have to look at my password because Why doesn't it autofill right? It's my work computer that you can't do that.
Andrew Daniels: yeah.
pat Petrakis: And then they make you change it all the time. But usually I thought they had gone to the PIV card sign in for everything the single whatever sign in
Andrew Daniels: it would be nice if they just let us all have one email and one password and we could just like
pat Petrakis: exactly I mean, why?
pat Petrakis: now they have to send me a code.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. yeah, the two-factor authenticate.
pat Petrakis: Alright. I'm almost there though. And you probably have it about On my TSB. Do you have for me somehow? a tsp link …
Andrew Daniels: I what Link, what do you mean?
pat Petrakis: no, because you just said I have 21,000 in there, but Account summary, here we go. Okay.
Andrew Daniels: no, didn't you tell me that beginning? I thought you told me that.
pat Petrakis: So right now I have 31,907 dollars.
Andrew Daniels: okay a little bit more. what's the split on that? Does it tell you which parts are off and which parts IRA?
pat Petrakis: yeah.
pat Petrakis: I have my
pat Petrakis: I can't be easier than
pat Petrakis: My God, it took me back to 2015. Okay? let me get to
pat Petrakis: Account activity, I guess I don't know.
pat Petrakis: Why can't I just see what?
Andrew Daniels: It's fine. I just got it kind of split between 20 and 11. It's 31 total.
pat Petrakis: Yeah it's kind of like that.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, I mean you're gonna let it grow in there. Anyways until we can do something with it.
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: So just as long as we have the values, I think it's good enough. 51
pat Petrakis: I have an account statement. So let's see. Could you have to download it? why can't it just link? It just makes no sense.
Andrew Daniels: I'm convinced the people that build this stuff don't actually use it themselves. That's
pat Petrakis: I think that maybe it's just me that
Andrew Daniels: all right. That is a
pat Petrakis: There we go.
Andrew Daniels: Rock
pat Petrakis: mmm here we go. Let's see. my gosh, it downloaded it into an Excel. Why would that do that?
00:30:00
Andrew Daniels: 
pat Petrakis: It's an account statement. I don't know.
Andrew Daniels: my gosh that's okay.
pat Petrakis: Yeah, I guess I don't know it is not. Okay, I should be able to maneuver around in this but that would be
pat Petrakis: why doesn't it should have the little pie graph, right?
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah, I've seen that. mine's got it on there my little tool have it.
pat Petrakis: I know it's just a little pie graph anyway, there's the Thrift Savings. 31,000 they would go there we go. Let's see.
pat Petrakis: It doesn't break it up into my wonder how I do that. I know what I should do. I can do it withdrawal and roll over because that's how I figured it out less. I'm like, how much do I have?
pat Petrakis: Okay, here we go So for both for right my Roth I have 12,613 and traditional is 19,000.
Andrew Daniels: We're very close. Very…
pat Petrakis: Yeah, you're right on.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, and you're still doing 400 a month each of those? Okay, awesome.
pat Petrakis: Yes.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, so that takes care of we got those updated. we've got your HomePath recorded the 205 that's out there.
pat Petrakis: So I have my Morgan Stanley. which
Andrew Daniels: Okay, so right I've got a 509 that's not Ira money at all. That's just regular brokerage account in 99. And then there's this other 1099 account.
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: That's 19,000. I don't know. I don't even have a note on that one.
pat Petrakis: a 1099
Andrew Daniels: Yes, it looks like there's 509 at Morgan Stanley and then there's 19,000 at least this one last time.
pat Petrakis: So I have my IRA, which is 553. And then my portfolio management 999. It's 36,000 today.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, I see I see.
pat Petrakis: And I think that's a look Liquid account that I could just draw out away. Of course now that I'm 59 and a half I can take whatever I want I guess.
Andrew Daniels: You're pretty. He said 36,000.
pat Petrakis: a 36 709
Andrew Daniels: these numbers have increased since the last time.
pat Petrakis: yeah because the stock market has gained. I don't want 15% the last. year and one of my averaging for
Andrew Daniels: Alright, so that setup is pretty common. And so the 553 is that Ira money? okay.
pat Petrakis: yes.
Andrew Daniels: So that's all qualified.
Andrew Daniels: okay, I see and Then the thirty six is non taxable. That's just like a savings account brokerage account.
pat Petrakis: Right. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: What? Okay, okay, and then we have to this 120 thousand dollar annuity the mega. How's that doing?
pat Petrakis: and my God Let's see. Let me look at that.
Andrew Daniels: And is that one also an IRA?
pat Petrakis: That one is also a split. Yeah, so me.
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
pat Petrakis: Let me type that in.
pat Petrakis: element that strong
pat Petrakis: What do you have suggestions on what I should do with the Morgan Stanley?
Andrew Daniels: Might my favorite play for you right now, since you're still working. I feel Justified with this, that 553 and 8% is another 44,000 per year. That's 36 86 per month. So while you're not using it?
00:35:00
Andrew Daniels: While you don't need it while you're still working if that's for another three years.
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: This is great gives you an opportunity, grow that let's see times 36 that's another 132 720 on top of that Over five years what I would imagine would happen so we could either do a three-year term or a five year, but there's something kind of cropping up as we're doing this. You got a lot of stuff front loaded into pre-tax accounts.
pat Petrakis: Yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Right and the way your money is gonna work after you retire and we want to try and reduce the amount of taxable income that you're gonna have. Obviously at some point your HomePath notes will collapse back into your policy loans and your policy will be filled up and ready to use.
Andrew Daniels: But I would think that over the next three years while you're working and you have active income. Take that 550 go get 45,000 a year on it let that just accumulate. And then we do Roth conversions. Honestly, if we could start the first one this year that would be ideal because the tax laws will change if they don't fix them in 2024 all the 2018 tax cut stuff is gonna set in 2024.
pat Petrakis: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: So this year is really the last Prime year given the fact that we don't know what the government's gonna do. We don't know what they're gonna come up with. They might be all these tax cuts are great or they might be like wow covid was really expensive. We're gonna let these things expire right and we're gonna get our taxes.
pat Petrakis: right right
Andrew Daniels: So I think what we should look at is trying to do a Roth conversion is that 550. all of that is tax Ira money.
pat Petrakis: Which one I might yes.
Andrew Daniels: The Morgan Stanley 550.
pat Petrakis: Yeah. Yes.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Anything that we could do to chunk that down and pay the taxes early on that would be beneficial in 2024 since you and Jean have a new way of doing Farm business. it might be optimal to do that and use that green Paradise savings to convert to a Roth conversion on Some of your pre-tax money and we could at least knock that down. We don't want to do it too much right because then you'll end up with a, tens of thousands of extra tax dollars. But if we can do it smart and…
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: recoup the interest. Hold on there was a way that I did this.
Andrew Daniels: that might not be. okay. I'll have to line that out. I'll have to think about that one and see so what I did for another lady was. we were doing a conversion and we were able to do what's called an indirect rollover where she was actually able to take constructive receipt of the funds. And as long as we get the funds back into the IRA within 60 days, it does not count as a taxable event now at the same time. not a rollover. We did a conversion. And the benefit of this was We paid up her life insurance policy premiums for the entire year.
pat Petrakis: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: And we also converted some of her Ira money at the same time. The conversion itself was a taxable event, but letting her have access to the money for 60 days to run it through the policy. Meant that we were able to give her a complete break on her policy premiums for 12 months.
pat Petrakis: …
Andrew Daniels: Picture this.
pat Petrakis: that's a taxi deductible though.
Andrew Daniels: It's not deductible, but it's not a taxable event.
pat Petrakis: got it. Okay, right.
Andrew Daniels: right Now if our goal is to make sure that you end up with the least amount of taxable income at retirement meaning what we really want to do is we want to make sure that most as much of your income as possible stays in your pocket and doesn't get chipped off by the government. If we can orchestrate a conversion like up your premium on the way out the door, then that gives you 12 full months. of where you're earning money from HomePath and it can't go into the policy because the policy will be full.
pat Petrakis: The problem is though is all that income from home path is taxable. So
00:40:00
Andrew Daniels: yeah, that's still a problem. No matter what.
pat Petrakis: it's
Andrew Daniels: You start making money. They're gonna tax it. This is…
pat Petrakis: day day
Andrew Daniels: why I had to go this I had to go nuclear with Jean and Sue because I'm like guys you don't understand how much income there's about to be like we gotta solve this now.
pat Petrakis: right Right. So my death benefit is 159,000, but my surrender value is 130,000.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, 1:30. Okay. And when does that come do?
pat Petrakis: Let's see here a surrender.
Andrew Daniels: Or I guess maturity date.
Andrew Daniels: Or maybe it's the time. Yeah.
pat Petrakis: I'm looking for.
pat Petrakis: come on.
Andrew Daniels: Do you remember how much you put into it?
pat Petrakis: I think I put 120 in.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, and if you're surrenders a hundred and thirty, so typically the way it works is you can either do it for five years or seven years.
pat Petrakis: Yeah, I think I did it for five because …
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
pat Petrakis: I'm 60 years old. I want to retire sometimes soon. But you know what?
Andrew Daniels: Right, right. So you were thinking.
pat Petrakis: I thought I probably did it for seven.
Andrew Daniels: You were thinking have access to that money by the time you're ready to retire. Yeah, that makes sense.
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: that guaranteed it five percent or something for five years.
pat Petrakis: Yes.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, that makes sense.
Andrew Daniels: 
pat Petrakis: I'm looking at.
Andrew Daniels: And do we remember when you bought it?
pat Petrakis: Yeah, it was.
pat Petrakis: five 12 20 22 I don't know…
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
pat Petrakis: I don't know. That's right because I feel like you and I had already talked and why would I do this? It's like I was 2021.
Andrew Daniels: I've
pat Petrakis: But it's the contact date says 5 12 20 22. so
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Yeah, I don't know. I mean either way,…
pat Petrakis: I don't know.
Andrew Daniels: It's not a terrible thing. I'm always for people that can get contractually guaranteed earnings. I would much rather you have a Miga that says we're gonna give you five percent per year then have it at risk in the stock market over covid and whatever shenanigan they're about to happen in November and whatever right? The one thing we can count on is that 130 will be there next January no matter what happens. So it just makes it so much easier to plan when we have the numbers that are set. so yeah,…
pat Petrakis: but
Andrew Daniels: so I'm thinking I see an opportunity here to if you're gonna get so the 40 so 553 gives you and there's some other options too.
Andrew Daniels: If you're moving away from spikes money, so here's what traditional advisors do and I mean you can tell me if he's doing this or not. But that 36,000 his feet probably comes out of that on a monthly or quarterly basis. So that's typically…
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: why they set up a sidepod account because they don't take their fee from the qualified money. They take their fee from the non-qualified side.
pat Petrakis: 
Andrew Daniels: So that's why I mean I could do traditional planning based on how I've seen everybody else. That's brought me their stuff that's used any kind of Edward Jones Schwab. Whatever. Am I'm like do these guys all just follow a Playbook like Yeah,…
pat Petrakis: Yeah, of course they do. I mean, of course.
Andrew Daniels: so what would be interesting is if we make a plan for that Ira money now, that's a pretty big chunk and this happens a lot. Especially the people in your income range, right? There's not really anything better to do with it.
pat Petrakis: he
Andrew Daniels: And you go for so long at high incomes. of course, you're gonna put money into your pre-tax Ira because you're trying to save money on those income taxes year to year. What happens is you end up with an overfunded IRA?
pat Petrakis: right
pat Petrakis: Why would you say it's overfunded?
Andrew Daniels: because it's only supposed to be for your retirement expenses and at 553. We can take an extra seven or eight percent out of that every year. But if we do that on a pre-tax basis now, this is doing all of our efficiency and maneuvering where we're going to get you higher income based on what you have somebody with at the 4% rule gets an extra 22,000 a year.
00:45:00
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: By the time you're 72, you should be able to get at least eight percent back on that or…
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: you can do what my director of accounting does. He's had HomePath for eight years or whatever and he's like, can I just live on this income and retirement? I'm like sure did whatever you want to do. I don't care or you can get 44 out of it.
pat Petrakis: I see, right.
Andrew Daniels: So you're peers and your colleagues that you work with? They think in order to get 45,000 in retirement that they need to save a million dollars.
Andrew Daniels: Because they can only withdraw four percent.
pat Petrakis: But I could do six or seven.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, which means you don't need to save a million dollars. You can get the same amount of income as someone who puts back a million. You're getting your income for half off.
pat Petrakis: so I really actually don't have a lot more about but my big thing is I want to get the crazy
Andrew Daniels: I don't think here look at this.
pat Petrakis: my loans paid off so I don't have that coming out every month.
Andrew Daniels: Right and I think you're very close to that too. I mean you're doing a great job. I'm very surprised with the numbers compared to what they were six months ago, but take a look at This is just what we have and now there's a big caveat here in that whatever's going on with that 553. We really don't know what's happening there and we don't know what could happen. So this is contingent on …
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: we're saying that Morgan Stanley is getting you six percent per year with no losses.
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: and that's going to continue so just keep in mind if we put that I'll show you the numbers here but as of now if they can actually promise US that they're gonna get you at least six percent. This is what it looks like. Free retirement up until we said 2027 so it goes through the end of 2026. And then you start your first year of retirement in And once this thing loads, right? Then we can see how this change is now. You've got a net monthly.
Andrew Daniels: Decrease like you've got your overspending initially, right? That's okay because we've got funds to draw from and those funds if you look at this, those are still growing.
Andrew Daniels: right contingent on the six percent. So what I'll do here and we can just kind of see I mean, I don't know what age is relevant to So if we went to 80.
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: We can see this is what your pension is. This is your Social Security that includes the cola instances and…
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: then we've got those expenses that are index for inflation. we did. Turn off the debts though. We planned for end dates. So included in this number are the fact that you will eventually stop paying on cars and student loans all and we can see that we've got an annuity. These are your income annuities, which I didn't even put any money in for the income annuities yet because we don't know when you're gonna take them, but I could put that in so about basically saying worst case scenario, If you're just living on Social Security and pension. You've got 1.8 million spendable assets by age 80.
pat Petrakis: Got it. I don't like those.
Andrew Daniels: 
pat Petrakis: I don't like those red numbers, but my monthly expenses are gonna be that high. Are they I hope not. or
Andrew Daniels: I mean and we can take that because that can skew the data a little bit. But let's come back to that…
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: because I want to show you the impact of what happens if we don't actually get and this is why I just don't do anything Securities license because it's just such a pain in the ass if they can't get you that six percent.
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: Let's say that
pat Petrakis: my biggest concern is It's gonna be minus 10% or money
Andrew Daniels: What?
Andrew Daniels: And that's where we'd run into a big problem so we can look at that and we can actually see what happens and let's give Spike the benefit of the doubt. Let's say it's only a three percent loss. In the next couple of years before you retire, let's not go crazy. what if Spike is in there every day watching your accounts like a hawk and he's able to stem the damage right and…
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: and you'll see here. I just put it before retirement. I'll pull it back up. And this is just like I'm gonna Spike all the benefit of the doubt. Let's say that he's able to keep you from everything but a 3% loss on just that account and…
00:50:00
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: then we're able to ramp back up to six percent after retirement. So I'm doing a fairly minimal Market loss. So we had 1.8 million at age 80 to spend.
Andrew Daniels: And that 3% loss cost you three hundred thousand dollars.
pat Petrakis: I mean I still have enough. I just can't crazy.
Andrew Daniels: Yes. right
pat Petrakis: Hey you but I just pulled up my Social Security estimate report. It's 18 A month and…
Andrew Daniels: what?
pat Petrakis: that's if I retire at 66 and a half years.
Andrew Daniels: 1800 is that…
pat Petrakis: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: and that 66 and a half.
pat Petrakis: hang on I'm gonna
Andrew Daniels: I wonder if that's because you have the federal pension.
pat Petrakis: s***. That's not fair.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, they do that with the pensions where they'll prorate the hold I got to zoom in on my screen here. How do I expand your?
pat Petrakis: Yeah, I don't know. Let's see.
Andrew Daniels: Let's see if I can get a bigger picture that. primary Insurance 1802 early retirement reduction. that's only $50 though. To one of 28. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: average indexed monthly earnings 36 13
pat Petrakis: but then I don't know what first would I'm logged into my retirement calculator.
Andrew Daniels: and are you logged in to Social Security, right?
pat Petrakis: thing that I have for this is through our work thing, so
Andrew Daniels: The problem is that I would go to social security.gov.
pat Petrakis: Here I could do that.
Andrew Daniels: They may not be calculating your entire work history is worth of Social Security. They might only be calculating what they know. They've paid you in Social Security. But how could that possibly be? Because your average monthly income should be more than 3,600.
pat Petrakis: I know that's what I think too with all the money I put in.
Andrew Daniels: yeah, I mean, it's not like you got a choice to put it in there taking it out and they're putting it in for you.
pat Petrakis: it might be that I mean, I don't know.
Andrew Daniels: that windfall provision we would see that on there as the counter calculation. That's when they reduce your social security for, pension benefits, whether it's features or federal or whatever. They will that's what that windfall provision does is it reduces your social security benefit, but I think we have to look at Social Security to get the real answer and Social Security is gonna have your entire work on the street and you've definitely worked at lots of places before you start at the VA.
pat Petrakis: yeah.
pat Petrakis: My ID. I tell you all these little ways to sign in there's the government log in there's that another.
Andrew Daniels: you got a full-time job. Just logging into stuff.
pat Petrakis: And this is my work computer. So I can't use my Google key or…
Andrew Daniels: right That's not helpful.
pat Petrakis: whatever. Wow.
Andrew Daniels: I don't like companies like limit being smart.
pat Petrakis: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: My I just put the 550 and…
pat Petrakis: What?
Andrew Daniels: 8% just to see what happened by 75 it got it up to two million dollars.
pat Petrakis: Dang by…
pat Petrakis: what you
Andrew Daniels: 70 …
Andrew Daniels: by 75 It's at 1.8, which it was at 80 before and then by 77 it's at two million.
Andrew Daniels: And we've still got a net monthly outflow. And I have people that do get a little worried about having too much money. they're overspending but some of that is kind of the point of why we said that you were gonna save up so much money to retire,
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: if you're not working anymore. It's kind of expected that you're gonna spend more than you're making.
pat Petrakis: I mean I would think that would be the thing you do when you are.
Andrew Daniels: what's interesting that we can look at is that turnaround point because the sooner we can get that turned around then I think you can get an extra level of security that you feel like. now not only retired with enough Capital, but I also am making more than I'm spending every month.
00:55:00
pat Petrakis: that would make me feel very comfortable, but Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah and there's still some things I can do. Let me put those athene annuities. I'll put in those payment amounts. And I'll just see what happens. If we said okay, let's go ahead and take that income when you're retired 2027. let's just turn on those income amounts and see how that changes because that might actually close the gap on that overspending.
pat Petrakis: But do I really think I'm gonna spend $7,000 a month. I mean,…
Andrew Daniels: yeah.
pat Petrakis: My utilities have gone way down because of our solar which is paid off with thanks to the insurance thing, but
Andrew Daniels: So yeah,…
pat Petrakis: I mean, yeah. Apple
Andrew Daniels: we run through just make sure because if we Sunset all of those debt payments, I just would double check that those are actually gone.
pat Petrakis: right right
Andrew Daniels: 2442
Andrew Daniels: I'll be interested to see what your Social Security says what your statement says as opposed to what the
pat Petrakis: Let's see. So I don't know what the bend Point means. my gosh.
Andrew Daniels: I'll bet you that that's some kind of Actuarial calculation.
pat Petrakis: Maybe my God. I just want to sign in on.
Andrew Daniels: but
pat Petrakis: I thought I had set up Social Security. My ID me?
Andrew Daniels: you set up the IRS one Social Security is different. Have you ever logged into Social Security before?
pat Petrakis: maybe but
Andrew Daniels: That's been years.
pat Petrakis: what I can do is I get off my work computer and go to my other one because it probably has I think I've signed into Social Security. I don't know.
Andrew Daniels: I see these Bend points.
Andrew Daniels: it's just a term that talks about what happens when you graph the primary Insurance amount because the great of change between the benefit determinations is consistent up to a certain dollar amount and then It reduces like you don't get as much benefit as quickly for having worked longer. After a certain amount, so they're kind of limiting how quickly you can earn more. So in the beginning of the graph or in the beginning of it,…
pat Petrakis: 
Andrew Daniels: it ramps up pretty well and then did it kind of slopes so that the rise is a little bit slower the longer you work the higher your benefit amount, but it's not as high as the very beginning so it's kind of incentivizing. It's giving more money quicker to people who have worked less or made less income.
pat Petrakis: Okay.
pat Petrakis: Got it.
Andrew Daniels: And then there's a middle segment…
Andrew Daniels: where it kind of gives an average amount of growth on the money for as long as you worked. And then at the very top end it really flattens out where there's kind of a maximum return working two or three more years doesn't get you as much more money as working two or three years in the middle does.
Andrew Daniels: I don't know if that made sense or not, but I'm not figure out…
pat Petrakis: It does. I did not know that they had done that.
Andrew Daniels: how to explain Good job.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. It makes sense.
pat Petrakis: I didn't know that was a thing. So.
Andrew Daniels: I mean I kind of agree with that that makes sense like yeah.
pat Petrakis: It does. I mean, okay, so
pat Petrakis: benefit estimates at age 67 it says 3,736
Andrew Daniels: That's what we had already planned on 3,736.
pat Petrakis: Yeah, and that's at age 67. So 66 Applebee somewhere between three thousand four hundred
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
pat Petrakis: so I don't know that extra seven that extra $300 a month. Should I work an extra couple of extra six months? Maybe I should
Andrew Daniels: Okay, so if you are. You can take Social Security and still work like we could file it and you could still be working.
pat Petrakis: what but why would I do that?
Andrew Daniels: you'd have extra money to do whatever you want with.
pat Petrakis: that is true, but I thought you couldn't work when you get Social Security. I thought you were limited after.
01:00:00
Andrew Daniels: it's not that you can't work above a certain dollar amount. They reduce your benefit 50 cents on the dollar for every two dollars you make over a certain amount. and it's based on how early you take it. yeah, and I'll be able to run the calculator on this. So I put in your full retirement age 67 years 37 46 and our program Will solve for that. Here's a cool thing that we could think about. So first off look at this. with the new Social Security in there.
Andrew Daniels: let me make sure I got it right here. no, I did not I also put in if you take your annuities at retirement at January of 2025 and you get the extra 370 a month from each of those that significantly so you can see where I put those in here, right?
pat Petrakis: All I see is your face.
Andrew Daniels: you see my face. I thought I should go.
pat Petrakis: I love your face, though.
Andrew Daniels: I did moisturize this morning. So hopefully I have left wrinkles.
pat Petrakis: Are you using coconut oil though? Those are okay.
Andrew Daniels: On my hair actually use coconut oil on my hair.
pat Petrakis: My God, you sound like Joe. it probably is nice and soft though.
Andrew Daniels: It doesn't help it does so I put the benefit and this is just if we take it in January 25, you might decide. Hey, we don't want that income until or we don't want that until 70 or whatever in which case this will be a lot more. So I put that in and then I said what happens if we are gonna get 8% on this money and we can guarantee that. let's just do that and…
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: what happens there and double checking for your expenses on
Andrew Daniels: This real estate taxes A lot of those are always going to be there that far mortgage.
pat Petrakis: 
Andrew Daniels: We have that far mortgage getting paid off in 2028. Are you still on track?
pat Petrakis: Right. Yes,…
pat Petrakis: that's true that
Andrew Daniels: okay, and then
Andrew Daniels: we've got those auto loans Ending by 26
pat Petrakis: they'll be gone. I mean because you said, I'm gonna waterfall those.
Andrew Daniels: I know. Yeah, they'll be gone even quicker. I think now that we've got some of this stuff.
pat Petrakis: right I'll do my student loans first.
Andrew Daniels: I think you should take that so here's what okay, I did a quick calculation on that. So the student loans there's seven point two percent, right?
pat Petrakis: Get Ridiculous
Andrew Daniels: But there's only twelve thousand dollars. right So there's a higher loan amount or…
pat Petrakis: Yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: a higher interest rate, but a lower balance.
pat Petrakis: And lower balance and the payment adds up to about 480 dollars a month. So what I really want to do is get rid of so
Andrew Daniels: I thought I had to hear that the payment was 245 is that not correct?
pat Petrakis: No, that's not. Hang on just a second. Let's see here.
Andrew Daniels: I am trying to zoom in here too,…
Andrew Daniels: so you can see.
pat Petrakis: You know what,…
pat Petrakis: what happened with that stupid student loan it's now managed by a different company because the first one got dinged by the government for being shyster and…
Andrew Daniels: you don't say surprise a student loan company was being shiesty.
pat Petrakis: that's not a very nice what it was. I know, right?
pat Petrakis: I know And so what ended up happening is they sent me to a different student loan so let me just find it here. my God. it's the advantage loan. and then Sorry, it's just I wonder…
Andrew Daniels: 
pat Petrakis: if I have that on my computer it's such an advantage. Because you know what? I'm telling the more I find out so I thought I knew all about how loans work. But not it worked that way with student loans.
Andrew Daniels: yeah. No.
pat Petrakis: It's
pat Petrakis: Aid advantage Of all things login. Let's see if I have we're here to help. Yeah.
pat Petrakis: 
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, you've got 14 so you could pay off the student loan and put another $2,000 on the next highest interest rate, which would be the Santa Fe, right?
pat Petrakis: And yes, Santa Fe is the next highest rate, and it has very high payments. It's like 749 a month. Isn't that insane?
01:05:00
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, yeah, and so then there's another side to things where we're talking about which one to pay off first. if we can throw all the mud against the wall at the Santa Fe freeing up $750 a month is way bigger than freeing up 300 that's twice as much money in your pocket.
pat Petrakis: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: But eventually…
pat Petrakis: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: what was once all those car loans drop off you can throw all that in the Farm loan will be gone in six months.
pat Petrakis: Yeah, that's true.
Andrew Daniels: So I think you're very close. this is really gonna work. you've done a great job of doing this I love it when a plan comes together.
pat Petrakis: So okay my and just of course that didn't work and now I'm locked out of my account. So right
Andrew Daniels: And I think okay, you't go wrong. So let's do this. You can't go wrong either way because if you pay off the twelve thousand dollars that'll wipe that off the books. You can just take that payment and…
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: apply it to the car loans. Or once you get in there, if you see it, here's how I would maybe look at it. If the payment on the student loans really is only $200 a month. It might be worth it to keep that 200 and get rid of the 342 a month payment.
pat Petrakis: mmm
Andrew Daniels: So you can put more money towards the Santa Fe.
pat Petrakis: Right, okay.
Andrew Daniels: Does that follow there are some situations where a higher interest rate on a lower balance is totally fine. Because the actual money out of your pocket isn't that much?
Andrew Daniels: So here I'll show you this. Where's my calculator?
pat Petrakis: Let me look.
Andrew Daniels: There it is. So if we were to just look at this and just do a real simple calculator, where's the calculator? I just
Andrew Daniels: Obama share my window here because I can do it fast. There you go.
pat Petrakis: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: I don't think there's a wrong way to do this.
pat Petrakis: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: But this is some things to think about when you're doing it and it might make more sense. So if we were to look over here at our we got our loans pulled up so your student loan. I don't know about the payment. We'll check that out. But if we take 0.72 or take seven percent And divide that by 365 multiply that by your balance. It's roughly costing you $2.36 a day to have that student loan. Does that make sense?
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: But if we compare that to what it's costing you to let's do the Santa Fe note we can't pay off. We don't have 27,000 readily available to Second.
pat Petrakis: right right
Andrew Daniels: So let's compare it to the Chrysler which you could pay off And so if you paid off the Chrysler right away that interest rate is at what 2.3 percent on the surface?
pat Petrakis: Mm-hmm
Andrew Daniels: That sounds like we should definitely pay off the 7.2 because it's a higher interest rate. But the real calculation is how much actual money are you out for that interest rate. So let's take two point three percent.
Andrew Daniels: Divided by 365 so I'm getting the daily interest charge on this and we'll multiply that times 13,000. Now I did that wrong. I already did this 2.3%
Andrew Daniels: times I'm Sorry by 365
Andrew Daniels: I must have done the 27,000 because it definitely makes sense to do that Chrysler first or to do that student loan first comparing the four point three percent.
Andrew Daniels: Cost you three dollars and 18 cents per day. So if you compared the
pat Petrakis: It actually is better to just go ahead and pay that Joe's car off.
Andrew Daniels: I think here's why. On the surface. The student loan is costing you more than the Chrysler. Obviously the interest rates are higher. What I'm looking for though is the payment amounts if Joe's loan is at 342 and your student loans really are only at 2:45. I would rather see you take the 245 dump it into the Chrysler and get rid of the Chrysler. If we had to do anything. The problem is if you take 14,000 from your policy, you could pay down the Santa Fe, but we're still going to have a 12,000 difference. So then …
pat Petrakis: work
Andrew Daniels: that doesn't help us at all. It doesn't give you any extra cash flow. So I guess either way pay off the student loan if and's I can tell you the right answer if the student loan payment is greater than the Chrysler 300 payment pay off the student loan and put all the extra towards whichever car you want. Probably the same thing.
01:10:00
pat Petrakis: right so I'd have a little extra money from what I can borrow from my policy right now and I could put that just one more principal payment. I mean for the Santa Fe There's not much.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, it's like you're going out to eat lunch literally every single day for $10 a day.
pat Petrakis: Yeah, I don't do that.
Andrew Daniels: I mean because you're paying the Chrysler or the Santa Fe, like that's why. But you have lunch you have a really nice lunch once a week and…
pat Petrakis: exactly
Andrew Daniels: still pay less than it's costing you to have that Santa Fe low.
pat Petrakis: Yeah, I got it, right.
Andrew Daniels: So, I mean, I think it'll still come together. but you have full totally take from your policy loan you have enough there. You can wipe out your student loan or the Chrysler or you could even For 14,000 in your policy if you've got an extra $5,000 you could take care of the Honda loan right away. Which would be the next highest payment to the Santa Fe?
pat Petrakis: right
pat Petrakis: I think that so I got a nice tax return. I was kind of saving it just in case. In crops up.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
pat Petrakis: I think I better save it as a crop up On the other hand I have that so I have that 36,000 that is liquid,…
Andrew Daniels: mmm Yeah,…
pat Petrakis: right? With something crops up,…
Andrew Daniels: you could take that. Yeah.
pat Petrakis: let's say the house is destroyed and I need a five thousand dollar deductible for my insurance or something. and I mean
Andrew Daniels: No, I mean that's a very reasonable case like scenario. Yeah, so that 36, you've got that Keep in mind your policy is going to continue to grow by a couple thousand dollars per month. At this point so that 14 is going to replenish itself pretty quickly over the next 12 months.
pat Petrakis: right
pat Petrakis: Okay. I've got a good okay. I think what I'll do is all I'm going to do that.
pat Petrakis: And then you said, Cascade everything in.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, you'll still have those payments but s** will get knocked off the books a lot faster.
pat Petrakis: It's amazing how fast it goes once if you're paying principal more than interest. They always have the interest first.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
pat Petrakis: It's creating. That's way it is. So anyway.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, so you're very close on those and honestly, I think I almost had this exact same situation that you're in happen with the guy who is within two to three years of retirement and it's crazy. He had almost the exact same amount on a pool alone. He had built a pool in his backyard and he had 48,000 left on his pool alone. It was sixty thousand dollars total. we did the same thing. We kind of waterfalled his debt then we used all of his extra HomePath money from his moves up here because we did the same thing. We pulled out of his 401k got it all under his control and then we used his home path money to finish off his pool alone the last 12 months of his retirement. I mean, he was nervous, but I knew it was gonna be fine because then the math is what it is and we use all that Home Path money to pay off his pool.
Andrew Daniels: outside of his regular income Yeah.
pat Petrakis: Say like that.
Andrew Daniels: So he ended up with the paid off all the stuff paid off and we had all the money but it only happened because we had that guaranteed income and then as he got into retirement we did exactly what we're talking about with you. We're chunking off pieces of the assets that we've accumulated and we'd start chunking those off for additional income and you can just see the difference and I'll put the scenarios together, but you can see the difference when I added, all right, so maybe for one year, you've got a couple thousand dollars a month that you're spending at between 66 and 67 but that ship writes itself pretty quick and now you're only at $1,000 a month less than $1,000 a month over.
Andrew Daniels: I'm gonna guess what happens here at age 72 between 72 and 73 what happens there is a required minimum distribution. That happens. Where you've got extra taxes in between these two years because we've got so much money in your tax money. So they're gonna say if you're considering moving that we can get extra income. We get forty five thousand dollars a year for it for over the next three years. So That's another 120,000 added to your bank account and a hundred or your retirement accounts. The value of that I'm doing the same calculation that we did with the value of an extra $120,000 at an additional four percent withdrawal rate.
01:15:00
Andrew Daniels: Is another 10 grand a year of income?
Andrew Daniels: I break that down. Not only do you have the $45,000 per year for the next three years, but you also get an additional $10,000 of retirement income at some point whenever we decide whatever annuity companies gonna pay you tell you die. We'll make sure that it's at least $10,000 a year with that. It might be when you're 72, but either way, that's how we bump up your income. $10,000 a year covers between 70 and 80 covers of $400 a month $500 a month overage.
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: So I need to do a little bit of work on these scenarios to get all the numbers perfect. I'm just kind of showing you on the Fly how we would make those changes.
pat Petrakis: as you also have told me in the past. I mean, it's probably likely that by the time I'm 72, maybe that it's to travel will be calm down. I don't plan necessarily just going to Europe every year or something. I mean if I travel it's gonna be, probably short trips.
Andrew Daniels: right
pat Petrakis: I don't know. I
Andrew Daniels: I mean there's stuff that I have that do you have an airline credit card?
pat Petrakis: Yes, I do.
Andrew Daniels: So if you're running all of your payments to Green Paradise through your Airline credit card.
pat Petrakis: I never thought about That point stop points.
Andrew Daniels: so you're cost of traveling because I mean, I've got American Airlines and I for fun. I was looking at International flights. It's the same 20 to 30 thousand dollar Redemption as it is to fly to Tulsa.
pat Petrakis: that's crazy, isn't it? In that is nuts.
Andrew Daniels: so if we're gonna squeeze efficiency out of it, why would we work you to death to make another million dollars just to have maybe a chance of 4% withdrawal if everything goes well and nobody in the government or the rest of the world screws anything up.
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: Over you just don't have to work that hard and let's just be a little more efficient with this stuff that we do. so yeah,…
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: so I need to kind of work some of those numbers and then probably the most complex thing that I'm thinking about is if we're gonna do something with the 550. On the way to transferring that because that'll go from Morgan Stanley wherever it's custodial now to another custodian that will allow you to do what we need to do with it. On the way there.
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: Can we orchestrate a Roth conversion on some reasonable amount that doesn't cause you a whole ton of taxes? But if you're gonna have deductions on green Paradise, can we orchestrate that conversion to where the interest money from home path effectively pays for that conversion. so now you're not out that money to pay for the conversion, but You do have the ability to reduce your future taxes instead of 550 being taxable. Maybe it's only 500 then we let that 50 grow up in the Roth account where it's never taxable.
Andrew Daniels: and respect to solve this tax problem that's happening and…
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: I didn't even show you this because I don't want you have a heart attack, but
Andrew Daniels: This would be your taxes that you owe and then you retire right? And there's two opportunities we have the first one is here.
pat Petrakis: Yeah.
01:20:00
Andrew Daniels: This year where the rates are lower and then the year that you retire orchestrating another conversion in the year that you retire. Because that's the lowest that you'll have a low tax year.
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: What's happening?
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: What's happening over time is as this graph shows if you can see the whole thing. That 8% in your IRA that's growing your IRA and now you're up again to 70 80 thousands of dollars of taxes.
pat Petrakis: my God.
Andrew Daniels: Because it's all packed in the ira. So we could do a couple of things now to mitigate that and…
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: what would happen is you'd actually take more money out of the IRA upfront and drain that account early.
pat Petrakis: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: so here's the cumulative tax. if you really want to have a breakdown by 2030. You'll pay four hundred ninety thousand dollars tax.
pat Petrakis: my God.
Andrew Daniels: So there's your million dollars right there. you want a million dollars. We could just get it by paying less taxes.
pat Petrakis: A bit so I thought you only pay taxes on the amount that you are taking out.
Andrew Daniels: that's true. But there is the rmd that happens and you can see where the graph kind of starts to ramp up as that rmd kicks in they're gonna make you take something out of the IRA. The good news is if we get a high enough care guaranteed rate of return either through an annuity or home path or whatever the IRS never plans. They don't ever do their formulas planning for people to actually make that much money, which is hilarious because they know people don't make that much money in the stock market or the retirement accounts.
pat Petrakis: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: So yeah, and I mean, I don't want to be the very bad news, but there's two things we can do we well and you don't have the option to stop making money and stop getting taxed. So you really have to press forward and make as much as possible so that you can pay these tax bills, but still have the lifestyle that you need. That's really where it's at. my joke is if you don't want to be taxed not making money. that's not an option. We're not gonna quit having income at the point.
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: And by the time you quit having income a significant portion of almost 50% of what you have saved is in pre-tax. So that's not all your money. You don't have 550,000 in your IRA at Morgan Stanley you have 40% of that is owed to the government.
pat Petrakis: Yeah. Wow, Keith. Sorry.
Andrew Daniels: So you've got, 53 minus 221. You've got three hundred thousand dollars. That's actually yours.
pat Petrakis: Andy don't talk to me. That's what
Andrew Daniels: That's right, and you let me keep going. I mean, and I'll find all the efficiencies, but You…
pat Petrakis: Wow, Jesus, what about it that way?
Andrew Daniels: that's three.
pat Petrakis: Yeah, I need to do something about The thing is what I don't want to do is right now in a high tax bracket already. I can't do too much without playing over like that. Whatever.
Andrew Daniels: Uh-huh. right
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, we really don't want to push you over the bracket. I'll calculate the number. Based on what I've got in here, for 204. Whatever. We think we can shave off with green Paradise is great. But even in 2024 243 725 is the bottom of the bracket and your income. Is it 347? I mean, that would be a hundred thousand dollars. We'd have to shave off. do you want to buy an MRI machine? that's the only way I can think of it.
pat Petrakis: My God.
Andrew Daniels: maybe you buy a full body, CT scanner and write it off as a, year one deduction then maybe we can save some of this up. I've got a client who's a plastic surgeon and that's literally what he does is every year he goes what piece of equipment am I gonna buy to offset all this income? but no I don't think it's an option to go. Okay, just stop making money. We need to press forward and start to accumulate as much as you can so that we can take the income and spin off the income in a way that doesn't impact you because now really the only way to cover that tax bill is to
Andrew Daniels: here's the annual taxes and that doesn't look quite as bad until you start getting into the 2030s and you realize that you got 25 27 28,000 of taxes in the 2030s. you're late 60s early 70s at that point and you're got a thirty thousand dollar tax bill. That's 2,500 a month.
01:25:00
Andrew Daniels: right
Andrew Daniels: there is actually a cool mathematical formula that says if the government charged less taxes and let everyone's accounts grow further the government would make more money, but they apparently don't know about that math.
Andrew Daniels: So yeah, I don't want to freak you out because I mean here's the deal. I think you could do well and all of this is if Spike does what he says he's gonna do. You could kind of leave things the same and probably be okay, but it's all contingent on that 550 being available to you.
pat Petrakis: exactly
Andrew Daniels: But I am ringing the bell a little bit with you on the tax thing because I know those Provisions sunset in 2024. I have not heard a peep of Congress thinking about extending those even slightly.
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: They don't even want anybody to remember that. They expire they are hoping that we get to 2025 or 2026 and everybody's gonna expect that 20 25 taxes are the same Congress will not have extended it and everybody's gonna be in for a giant tax like bomb in 2026.
pat Petrakis: Yeah, Congress did that I mean they better get their asses together.
Andrew Daniels: They're just yeah.
pat Petrakis: That's all I can say. But anyway.
Andrew Daniels: Here's hoping we're still waiting on 180 years of that. So no,…
pat Petrakis: I know I know.
Andrew Daniels: I don't think any of this is an emergency. I'm actually very excited for you on the debt. I know that was a big goal for you to get that taken care of and I'm going to the other page here. I think it's going along really well, so you can give yourself a pat on the back for the debt. I think you're gonna get that knocked out two years flat and you'll have that done. But that's still only a total of about 27. I think it's about
pat Petrakis: but those reasons
Andrew Daniels: But 17 1800 Plus. 1100 so yeah. 3800 a month
Andrew Daniels: That right of what's going out to all your loans now?
pat Petrakis: yeah, yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, 2800. that's gonna help out a…
pat Petrakis: I need to get rid of that.
Andrew Daniels: That's not gonna cover 25,000 a year taxes. You see our problem like we can take care of the debt all day long.
pat Petrakis: No. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: We could take care of.
pat Petrakis: But I thought if I was only let's say take out 45,000 a year with everything that I get. that's not Yeah, that's about right the pension the Social Security that required my required distributions could be what about $800 total for my and 500,
Andrew Daniels: on 500,000
Andrew Daniels: Plus, I mean, there's rmds On the annuities on whatever other pre-tax money you've got.
pat Petrakis: yeah, I'm the annuities.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, I think you should plan for the Army. this will tell us exactly what your rmd Hold on a second. Rmd tracker. We've got it right here.
Andrew Daniels: 
Andrew Daniels: they must have bumped it up to age 75. So that's what happened at 75. I think they did bump it up to 75. So. As that traditional IRA money grows, right? There's the rmd required at 75.
pat Petrakis: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: you're gonna have your 40 you're gonna have your forty thousand dollars a year just from your rmds. And if we grow that account in a home path if it's 6% it'll be a little bit less.
pat Petrakis: right
Andrew Daniels: But no, I think your Army's gonna be a little higher today. Which that's where you take that tax bill hit. Is having an extra $40,000 and the thing is you're 75 years old. What if you don't need here's the big question that I run into with people who are over 70. What if you're 75 and you're like, I don't need that $40,000 this year. I had a surgery and I don't plan to travel anywhere this year. Whatever right? Then you still have to take it and it still causes the tax problem an insane thing about it. So I have people that call me at 73 and they're like I'm getting killed on these rmbs. I don't spend that much money is there something you can do and I'm like no, it's too late to transfer it. I can't take it all out because it causes a huge tax bill.
Andrew Daniels: So okay Spike can guarantee you six percent until 75. Your rmbs are still going to be 29,000 a year. Which that puts you that bumps you up way over provisional Social Security, So your Social Security's already going to be 85% taxable. even the migas 10,000 the tsp where it's at now is 2700.
01:30:00
Andrew Daniels: And then this is the year by year analysis, so I'm just doing that first year 2036.
pat Petrakis: You know what? I'm gonna have a very very expensive. shed or something
Andrew Daniels: I know someone who will be excited to hear about that.
pat Petrakis: Hey, listen Amy, I got to go a Brock and beats and Bella thank you so much.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Yeah.
pat Petrakis: I appreciate this.
Andrew Daniels: Let me work on these scenarios and I'll send kind of everything all together for you, and then I'll shoot you this recording and then if you need help your life insurance stuff,…
pat Petrakis: Perfect. Okay. Thanks.
Andrew Daniels: just let me know. all right,

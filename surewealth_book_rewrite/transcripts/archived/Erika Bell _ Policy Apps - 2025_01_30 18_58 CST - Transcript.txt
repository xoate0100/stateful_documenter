Andrew Daniels: Yeah, the kids wanted to go to the McDonald's play place the other day and…
Andrew Daniels: I said absolutely not.
erika bell: Nope. call them terms.
Andrew Daniels: You guys can play outside in five degrees until as long as you can last. But we are not going inside that place.
erika bell: Nope. That's a look, that's just a disaster waiting to happen,…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, they were really sad, but I was like, "Guys, do you really want to get sick?" And then they were like,…
erika bell: right? No,…
Andrew Daniels: "No, not really." …
erika bell: cuz once one gets sick, the whole house going to be sick.
Andrew Daniels: that's what I said. I was like, "You know how this works, guys. We've watched it happen now every year. Let's just stay away.
Andrew Daniels: 
erika bell: All right,…
erika bell: let's not do it this time.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. …
erika bell: But how are you otherwise?
Andrew Daniels: We're making our way with the snow here. We had the biggest snow in 40 years. many that we couldn't open our back door.
erika bell: How many get Wow.
Andrew Daniels: The screen door was blocked with all the snow. It was 14 inches. Yeah, it was too much.
erika bell: That's That's not going outside for three, four days. That's crazy.
Andrew Daniels: And of course, our driveway is on a slope, so I didn't shovel it because I was like, whatever. So,…
erika bell: Nope. we'll wait until it melts.
Andrew Daniels: we did. And it's still on the ground. It hasn't completely melted yet.
Andrew Daniels: So, we're still just whatever. It was 55 degrees today, so that took care of most of it. Yeah. Okay.
erika bell: That's good.
erika bell: That's goody so that I could get some figures from And I know that Mary was suggesting that I ensure the boys and I don't know how that works. but I know that in 2025 I'm ready to do something.
erika bell: I don't have a lot of money to roll in, but I need to start somewhere.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: And so with the numbers the way we can do it with any amount. the goal is and when you get policies on other children or whatever basically you would be the owner and you'd have full control of the policy doing whatever you need to do with it. Once you're passed away those policies can automatically transfer to the insured with no taxable consequences.
Andrew Daniels: Then they take over the policy. And so there's a bunch of different ways like you don't have to wait until you die. You can put it into a trust and have the trust manage it, whatever, but essentially the goal is on whatever amount to start growing that accessible cash portion and have it available so that whatever the ups and downs financially can then be covered and not interrupt the growth. That's the biggest piece of it is being able to deal with whatever life throws at you but not have it interrupt the growing part.
Andrew Daniels: What numbers are you thinking of? I mean before I Yeah.
erika bell: I don't know.
erika bell: That's just it. I have no idea. I have no idea.
Andrew Daniels: What So, let's go at it from a different angle. what amount are you wanting to put away? Or I guess what can you afford to put away as if you're just like, "Hey, I'm putting this into savings and I'm not going to touch it." What is there an amount that you have like that? Or maybe there's not an amount you're like, "Nah, I can't even do that." Okay.
erika bell: If I say $300.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, that's fine. and then hold on. I'm trying to pull up your Oops. Yeah. And that's a perfectly good amount to start. So that we'd have to run some numbers and…
Andrew Daniels: what that would do. healthwise is do you have an MS diagnosis on the record?
erika bell: That is a good question.
erika bell: I don't know that I have an official I don't know…
erika bell: where they would pull up my information and it says I have MS. I don't know because I'd like to find that out. If I do then I want to apply for disability.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, that's a good Yes,…
Andrew Daniels: that's a good thing. tell me have you been seeing a single doctor regularly or…
Andrew Daniels: are there multiples where you've kind of pieced this together?
erika bell: There's been multiple doctors,…
Andrew Daniels: Okay. …
erika bell: but for the most part, I'm seeing one now. She did say that I have MS and I'm being treated for MS. I don't know if it's because MS is one of those things that are clinically reported, correct? But…
00:05:00
Andrew Daniels: yeah. Yeah.
erika bell: how and where?
erika bell: So, I'd like to go through the process with me and see what they find. I'd like to I don't know how forthcoming I have to be, but I would like them to come back and tell me what it is or what they find out.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. …
erika bell: I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing.
Andrew Daniels: I would think so when you've gone and…
Andrew Daniels: seen different doctors, has it been referrals for tests? Has it been you not really being satisfied with the level of care and going to someone else or combination thereof?
erika bell: It's been mostly referrals and…
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Right.
erika bell: just trying to pinpoint what's wrong because I've had health issues for years now,…
erika bell: I have had repeated pulmonary embolism. I've had blood clots in my lungs on five different occasions.
Andrew Daniels: My god.
erika bell: and I don't have a clotting disease.
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
erika bell: We don't know why it continues to happen. but I have lesions on my brain. most recently they said I had lesions on my spine which led them to believe that I have MS. But I've been diagnosed, misdiagnosed. Like they told me I had They tested me for lupus for sarcosis. I've been tested for so many different things and they've kind of landed on I don't know if she has me down clinically with I am taking MS medicine. I just had an appointment recently with the doctor.
erika bell: Is there a question that I would need to ask? Because I can always just send a message and ask, right?
Andrew Daniels: Hello. …
Andrew Daniels: yeah, it might be worth it to call the doctor's nurse and say, "Look, I'm going to try to apply for some life insurance, and I need my record clean and accurate. Anything that we thought was a problem that turns out it wasn't a problem, it needs to be marked as completed, closed, disposed of, we thought it was, but it wasn't. So now we're not even considering that.
erika bell: Right. Thanks.
Andrew Daniels: I think there's a little bit of data cleanup that's warranted, one of the things that I think you should do, I'm going to send you two, I'm going to send you two links. …
Andrew Daniels: one of them is called the MIB report, the medical information bureau report.
erika bell: Okay. No,…
Andrew Daniels: Have you ever heard of this?
erika bell: I haven't.
Andrew Daniels: It's like a credit report for your medical history,…
erika bell: For your health. my god. It's going to happen.
Andrew Daniels: right? …
erika bell: I've been in the hospital 50 times. for the most part I've had health insurance.
Andrew Daniels: and generally I've only seen it for life or health insurance. So, if you have had continuous health insurance, there might not be a lot of information on it. but to we want to Yeah.
erika bell: I've had health insurance for the last 20 30 years. I've really only had short periods of time where I didn't have health insurance.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. …
erika bell: that's not good.
Andrew Daniels: I'm going to send you the other link is for your Lexus Nexus credit report.  And this is where it's not a credit report like Experian or Equifax where they give you a number based on credit cards. Now some of that information is on the Lex but Lexus Nexus controls a lot of the information the data reporting for stuff that's not specifically credit cards or financial accounts. So a lot of insurance related items are on Lexus Nexus.
Andrew Daniels: And so I think before we do an application or anything on you, we should look at that to find out what's out there and what's available for them to find on you. the other thing is they will contact your primary doctor for a statement,…
Andrew Daniels: right? …
erika bell: Right. Right.
Andrew Daniels: there's some ways that we can maybe get Not really get around it because I don't want to get around it. We want them to offer the coverage and we want them to guarantee that coverage once you have it we don't want it to be contestable because of some kind of omission or misment. …
erika bell: Right. Right.
Andrew Daniels: generally there's a way that we can disclose stuff. And what I've found is a lot of times if things are being treated, if they're being looked at by a doctor, if they're being managed by a doctor, that does give you a better rating or it allows them to say, "Yeah, you can get this right." the times that I've had problems I've had people with traumatic brain injuries and they're being managed and they're approved for life insurance, right? And I've had other people…
00:10:00
erika bell: Right. Gotcha.
Andrew Daniels: who claim, I'm healthy as a horse, but I don't see a doctor. Okay, you actually have undiagnosed diabetes. Your levels are way nuts. We're not even going to look at you until you see a proper doctor. So, because it's unmanaged,…
erika bell: Gotcha.
Andrew Daniels: 
Andrew Daniels: that's a big red flag for them. So, right now,…
erika bell: Got it. Because if it's Okay. No, I've been seeing a doctor for year.
Andrew Daniels: the other Yeah.
erika bell: I've been seeing all kinds of doctors for years. right?
Andrew Daniels: And the other thing that I think they're going to want to that has caused a problem is when there's incorrect or outdated information on the current doctor's records, And if you just saw them, that should be good. The best thing to do is to go in and I've done this with myself.  I've said, "All right, nurse, you're doing my intake. Can you tell me on my chart? what kinds of things are on my chart?" And they'll say, "We've got you down for this or that or this medication." I'm like, "No, I don't take that anymore. You need to remove that." And so, they'll mark it as, historical and you really do have to like you because they are moving fast. They have to get through all their documentation and they got to move on to the next patient. they know they're being timed on all that stuff.
Andrew Daniels: So, you have to force them "Hey, I need only the stuff that is a current medical issue on my record. Get the rest of it off of there. Take the time and make sure it's marked as a closed issue." And when you do that,…
Andrew Daniels: generally it leads to because what they'll do is they'll start with a scalpel and end with a hacksaw. If they see old stuff on there, they'll either say, "This stuff is too much. We don't want to underwrite you." Or they'll say, "You have to go complete that test. You have to go get a statement from that doctor." and they'll send you to do a bunch of stuff and a lot of times it's not necessary. If you can just go and get it closed as a closed issue, then they'll be like, " it was in the past and it was longer than two years ago, so we're not even going to worry about it." on Yeah.
erika bell: Got it.
erika bell: Do I have a way to dispute that other than with the doctor directly? it only could be cleaned with the doctor that reported it.
Andrew Daniels: Here's generally what you can do. whoever you're seeing currently, They should be able to see all of your chart records. when you go to a doctor, generally they pull your information from other doctors that you've been to. so if it's easy enough to go back to some of the doctors, so here's an example. I had a lady who had a referral for some kind of neurological thing, And it was scheduled, but she never actually went. She called up that office and said, "Hey, I know this was scheduled. I didn't go. Can you make sure that it's marked off that it wasn't needed?" And they…
Andrew Daniels: "Yeah, sure." And they just took it off her chart.
erika bell: …
Andrew Daniels: And it was that simple, And her primary doctor noted that it wasn't necessary. He was the one who originally made the referral. So, he just retracted it on his chart and said, " we figured out this wasn't necessary. There is a question about receiving disability payments.
erika bell: I have intentionally left a laundry list of stuff on my medical record only because I have been considering disability. Now, I'm wondering, are you insurable if you're disabled? I'm not there yet.
Andrew Daniels: 
Andrew Daniels: Let me think. Have I?
erika bell: I'm not there yet.
Andrew Daniels: Yes,…
erika bell: That was kind of like my right.
Andrew Daniels: I actually do have a client who is on disability now who was approved at a standard rate. So, it doesn't necessarily preclude that. I think more of the reasons why you're on disability are what they're going to look for. so it may be best…
erika bell: Got it.
Andrew Daniels: then to start building your base with the kids as the primary source for your as holding that. how old are they?
erika bell: Justin is 19 and…
erika bell: Jaden is 23.
Andrew Daniels: They're going to have amazing rates. that might be something you want to focus on anyways, for them though, they'll have to agree to get underwritten. Basically, they'll just have to sign the form and you can tell them that you're like building a legacy plan for them because all of this money is eventually going to transfer to them.
erika bell: But they won't have any clue about what I'm trying to say, so I probably would have to explain it.
erika bell: But I also don't want them to feel like I'm doing anything weird or shy or,…
00:15:00
erika bell: inappropriate with their names.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. No,…
Andrew Daniels: I mean, no, you can always buy insurance for them and you can tell them "Hey, this is going to be my gift to you.
Andrew Daniels: This is how I'm going to gift Not just some wealth, but when you have kids, it's going to kickstart your generational wealth because this will be yours someday. But I'm gonna start by paying for it." Well,…
erika bell: When I hear that,…
erika bell: I think about time share. is it a bad thing to pass along health insurance? I mean,…
Andrew Daniels: it's not No,…
erika bell: life insurance.
Andrew Daniels: no, not health insurance.
erika bell: No, I mean life insurance. Wow.
Andrew Daniels: When they die, their kids are going to get probably several million dollars a piece from what you do just…
erika bell: So what about now with them I'm just trying to so I'm paying into their insurance and…
Andrew Daniels: just because they're so young.
erika bell: if I pass away…
erika bell: then they have to start paying into the same insurance. Perfect.
Andrew Daniels: Maybe we'll see.
Andrew Daniels: The premiums don't have to be due forever, We can always shut off the premium. So, we can talk about that and we can say here's what we'd like to happen. I think ideally what I'd like to see happen is that you get some kind of policy with a death benefit. It may be that we have to limit how much that policy is in order to get it past underwriting.
Andrew Daniels: So generally the lower the death benefit, the more generous and easy the underwriting. And we may even be able to get some non-medical underwriting because you're still young enough to qualify for non-medical. Yes.
erika bell: Because ultimately I want to have life insurance so…
erika bell: if something does happen they can get that I have a policy…
erika bell: where they can get paid immediately.
Andrew Daniels: Yes. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: And the idea would be with your death benefit that funds their generations of policies completely up. They can use the cash in and out of it, but they wouldn't have any more premiums. And then that kickstarts the snowball because their policies are just by very nature going to be larger than yours was. And if they continue that generationally, it should get larger each time. So, that's usually and when I've got grandparents that buy it on grandkids when they're zero years old.
Andrew Daniels: So that's ultimately and…
erika bell: Right. It does.
Andrew Daniels: it's really going to depend on what we can get for you as a death benefit while probably staying under non-medical limits if that makes sense. That way, they don't even have a reason to go look at your records. Yeah. Yeah.
erika bell: I definitely want to do something like that for sure cuz I have benefits at work, but I'm like, what happens when I stop working? Those benefits go away.
Andrew Daniels: I mean, you definitely won't have life insurance from the job anymore at that point. And it makes Yeah.
erika bell: And I'm paying for it now. So, I'm just paying for something I'm not going to use if I quit.
Andrew Daniels: And they know 2% of term policies ever pay out. they know they're probably not going to have to pay out on that. you're going to quit or it'll get too expensive by the time you actually get to the point…
Andrew Daniels: where you're going to pass away.
erika bell: Right. Got you.
Andrew Daniels: So, okay. So, yeah, I'm going to send you these two links because I think getting these medical reports and just finding out what's out there, I think that's a good practice anyways. I don't like the idea that our data is all over the place. So, I want to empower you a little bit to go take control of that. If there's stuff on there that's old or outdated, you can dispute it. It falls under the same stuff as the Fair Credit Reporting Act. And I can even help you do that. there's just a simple template letter we can send in and say, "Hey, get this off of here. It's not real.
erika bell: And I do want to also you're going to look at me like a different person when you see all this debt on my credit, but I would absolutely like to work with you with the credit repair. Wendy was saying that you helped her with her credit repair.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. No, I can definitely do that.
Andrew Daniels: Depending on the scope of it, do you have a credit report that you've pulled at all lately?
erika bell: No, my score is really low.
erika bell: I think I have some recent debt that was added a couple things that were written off, but I think I got a call from somebody said they want to send me a 1099 for something that I didn't pay and…
erika bell: I'm like and then the rest of it is just small credit card debt, but I pay that regularly.
Andrew Daniels: …
Andrew Daniels: It's actually really easy to manipulate the credit score. That's actually not a difficult thing to do. in this email, can I'm gonna order a credit report from myfico.com. This is by far the most authoritative source and it's a threebureau pull, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. And if we can get that, it'll give us an idea of where to start.
00:20:00
Andrew Daniels: A lot of times with just one credit report or just with the very first step cleaning up all the outdated information,…
Andrew Daniels: a lot of times stuff automatically falls off because they have to be able to verify and data errors. If your name is not exactly correct, if they've got an old phone number, if they have an old address, all of a sudden you remove all that, they can't cross reference it anymore.
erika bell: Got it.
erika bell: So, anything associated with that old stuff falls off.
Andrew Daniels: All of a sudden it can't be validated…
Andrew Daniels: because they don't have a correct address and it's not the same person and that is the law. This is not shenanigans. This is us following consumer protection law. So that's tough to them.
erika bell: Right. And…
erika bell: What about the collection companies that buy somebody else's debt?
Andrew Daniels: Those are the best. First off, never talk to them on the phone ever again. Do not speak to a single person on the phone about that. Never confirm. If you get a call from a debt collector, you should say,…
Andrew Daniels: "I'm sorry. I cannot deny any personal information from someone who calls me. You will have to send a letter to whoever you're trying to reach." That is your standard response.
erika bell: Got it.
erika bell: I like that.
Andrew Daniels: The problem is, if you engage with them on the phone in any way, shape, or form, you will automatically, in most cases, wave your federal rights to fair collections practices.
erika bell: Good Didn't know that.
Andrew Daniels: But if you make them send a letter, you retain the rights to it. Yeah. …
erika bell: Got it.
Andrew Daniels: so depending on the scope of it, there's a couple of different ways. If it's easy stuff, I can help you with some of the easy stuff. If it's more complicated, I'm going to recommend that you get with Weightless Financial. they're the ones that you can actually get registered as an agent without a life insurance license. And you can actually get a commission on your own debt.
erika bell: Stop it.
erika bell: You just let me know what your fees are when I got to do all this stuff and I am just so buried in I've made a lot of bad decisions financially. A lot. yeah, but it's like all right, you're 55 now, girl. why are you still making the same stupid mistake?
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, that happens though.
erika bell: And Rohan, my husband now, he's, always wanted to give me everything I want, so he's in debt.
erika bell: So we're really trying to just change the spectrum of what we've been doing. but I know I need life insurance if I can talk to my boys about what this would look like for them because I want to be as forthcoming with them as possible. and I do want to make sure that whatever we discuss,…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
erika bell: we include a death benefit for them. that they're my beneficiary to my whatever standard policy I can get.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah,…
Andrew Daniels: I think that makes sense. the order of operations here is this. sounds like first off,…
Andrew Daniels: get your free Lexus Nexus and your medical and information bureau reports. Get those and…
erika bell: credit for it.
erika bell: Okay. Rocket
Andrew Daniels: what kind of stuff is on there. If there's nothing on there, the next step then and we don't have to do anything with those. Call your doctor's office and say, "Hey, I'm getting life insurance. I need anything that's a previous issue that's not a real issue. I need it out I need it either removed or marked as closed."  And honestly, I don't think you're gonna hurt your chances of disability if that's really what you need because, whatever the thing is that's causing the problem. If it prevents you from working and the disability is required, then that's going to be the thing It won't be all the things that aren't actually things. Does that make sense? I know.
Andrew Daniels: I know that's Yes,…
erika bell: I want to work for myself and Right with the boy.
Andrew Daniels: that's what we got to get towards and there's freedom in that for you're gonna get if you want to is there a time that you guys all meet together? Do you guys have dinner together or anything? Or do you want to try and coordinate the three of us talking? Yeah. Yeah.
erika bell: Yeah, I think that would be a good idea. Yes. and…
Andrew Daniels: I mean, because that way I can just explain here's what your mom's thinking of doing. Here's the benefits to her. And here's kind of how we set this family up generationally.
00:25:00
erika bell: we could do that this Sunday I'm going to a funeral. I won't be home, but we could do it maybe next Sunday.
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: Is That's the ninth.
erika bell: Let me look.
erika bell: Whatever day is convenient for you.
Andrew Daniels: Not that I particularly. Sorry. Go ahead.
erika bell: No, no. whatever evening is convenient for you. I typically don't get home from work…
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
erika bell: until about 7:30, 8 o'clock.
Andrew Daniels: No, I'll make time for you, Erica. If I tell…
erika bell: I appreciate you,…
Andrew Daniels: if I tell Mary…
erika bell: …
Andrew Daniels: if I tell Mary that I've got a meeting with Erica, she'll be like, "Get over there and help her out. Don't come back until she's all fixed up." …
erika bell: 's sweet. That's sweet.
Andrew Daniels: but the 9th is Super Bowl Sunday, and that doesn't matter to me,…
erika bell: Yeah. …
Andrew Daniels: but it might matter to you and the boys.
erika bell: it might matter to the mister, not me, but maybe to the mister. let us
erika bell: So 8 o'clock my time is 7 o'clock your time and Jaden. Yeah,…
Andrew Daniels: Correct. Yeah,…
Andrew Daniels: you're one.
erika bell: So that'll give me some time if we do maybe the following Sunday. Maybe that'll give me enough time to pull my records and…
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
erika bell: stuff. Yes. Okay.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, I think that's fair. So, the 16th then? Yeah. No, that's fine. because yeah, there is a little bit of work to do and I'm going to put all this in an email for you so you don't have to remember it or anything. I'll get this all put together. you're going to need to order a credit report from my FICO. It's $30, but it's going to be the most comprehensive look that we have. And then I'm going to send you the link for the weightless financial once I look at your credit report. That way, I'll just send the link anyways.
Andrew Daniels: You can get registered with them as an agent right now. And if you got friends that are in debt, if Rohan wants to get in it, whatever, they will pay you directly any commission from any debt that people enroll in it.
erika bell: Yeah,…
erika bell: I definitely didn't want to do that. between me and Yeah, I do.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah. So, that could be a nice little amount for you.
erika bell: Okay,…
erika bell: sounds good.
Andrew Daniels: But yeah,…
Andrew Daniels: no, a lot of this is going to be some upfront heavy lifting, but based on what I've seen other people go through when we start getting all this cleaned up, I think you're going to have more control and flexibility than you've ever had. And it's going to feel really good because we're going to put a stake in the ground and we're going to give you a solid footing to start growing from. And, that's going to be the most important piece. I can't tell you s to, whether you're going to have a policy completely or if we'll have to do it kind of split ways.
Andrew Daniels: But the goal will be you build up your own capital and it generationally passes to the boys automatically without a lot of rigomearroll or taxes. Yeah.
erika bell: Yeah, that's…
erika bell: what I'd like to talk about with them on the phone. Okay. All right.
Andrew Daniels: So, yeah.
erika bell: So, got some love,…
Andrew Daniels: No, it's good. I can help you with all this and I'm excited to. And Mary was like, "You better set her up cuz she's my friend." I'm like, "I got this." Okay.
erika bell: I love y'all. Okay, so I'll look forward to the email and I'll get started.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. I'll reach out to you closer to the 16th to figure out…
erika bell: All right.
Andrew Daniels: what a good actual time of the day is for that. You're thinking evening time on Sunday.
erika bell: Midday. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Midday. Yeah.
erika bell: It's fine. It doesn't have to be.
Andrew Daniels: Sounds Yeah, I should be good then. that'll be fine. Yeah, let's get this cleaned up.
erika bell: So, we'll work on it and I'll let you know as I get stuff done.
Andrew Daniels: There's a lot of You'll feel so good and I'll bet your health will take a turn for the better, too, because the financial stress is not good for you. So, let's get that out of here.
erika bell: I agree 100%.
erika bell: All right, sir. Talk to you soon.
Andrew Daniels: All right.
erika bell: Thank you.
Andrew Daniels: Talk to you soon. Bye.
erika bell: Wait a minute.
00:30:00
erika bell: to where you are. I control
erika bell: What's up?
erika bell: But I don't like
00:35:00

00:40:00
erika bell: What are you?

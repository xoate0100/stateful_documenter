Andrew Daniels: Is there a little white button at the bottom of your screen that looks like a microphone?  You want to call me on Kim's phone, but leave the presentation on Mark's so that we can see it if we need to share screens. Can you hear me? If you can see this at the bottom of your screen, there should be some buttons for you to unmute.
Andrew Daniels: There you go.
m h's Presentation: Is he on there? Yeah. …

00:05:00
Andrew Daniels: Now I can hear you and I can hear you and…
m h's Presentation: Can I hear him? there's my sound.
Andrew Daniels: I can see you.
m h's Presentation: I'm working on it. Technologically challenged.
Andrew Daniels: No worries. I can hear you.

Andrew Daniels: Not hearing me.
m h's Presentation: What am I got?
Andrew Daniels: We're almost there. What kind of phone do you have?
m h's Presentation: How come I can see him…
m h's Presentation: but I can't hear him?
Andrew Daniels: I can hear you.
m h's Presentation: the volume button on there. You got to set I got my volume all the way up on the video. Mama, I don't know.
Andrew Daniels: Hold up. We'll get there. Just give me a second.
m h's Presentation: I'm trying to figure it out.
Andrew Daniels: Yep. It's good.
m h's Presentation: Full screen. No, no, no. What happened?
Andrew Daniels: Nope. I did that.
m h's Presentation: S***. What did I do?
Andrew Daniels: I did that.
Andrew Daniels: That would mean Can you see my screen?
m h's Presentation: There we go.
m h's Presentation: I can't hear him. I can see you, but I can't figure out how come I can't hear you.
m h's Presentation: I wonder. No, cuz I'm unplugged. Wait a minute. Settings. I'm disconnected from everything.
Andrew Daniels: Are you connected to a Bluetooth?
m h's Presentation: I don't know, dude. I figured it out.
Andrew Daniels: .
m h's Presentation: Try me now.
Andrew Daniels: All right. How about now?
m h's Presentation: right. winner chicken dinner we are.
Andrew Daniels: Are we connected? We got it.
m h's Presentation: Hello. Pleasure to meet you,…
Andrew Daniels: Just took a minute.
m h's Presentation: for a dinosaur.
Andrew Daniels: That's good. This technology is going to be the end of us.
m h's Presentation: I'm just happy I figured it out.
Andrew Daniels: I'll tell you what.
m h's Presentation: Not now.
Andrew Daniels: I don't even know if we'll need it, but I did want to be able to show you guys kind of the numbers that I'm tracking and just a lot of times when we're talking about this stuff, it makes it easier if we can see the numbers on the screen as we go. so yeah.
m h's Presentation: I got you.
Andrew Daniels: A couple of things.
Andrew Daniels: Were you guys ever able to figure out or did you ever get logged into the social security at all and figure out your social security benefit?
m h's Presentation: I don't think I got that. I did not, young man.
Andrew Daniels: Okay, No worries. I'm going to we'll do an estimate for now and then we can adjust that later.
m h's Presentation: 
m h's Presentation: I'm putting you on a tripod.
Andrew Daniels: No worries. I'm still connected. So, we're still I'm still connected. We're still good.
m h's Presentation: All right.
Andrew Daniels: It's all good. let's see.
m h's Presentation: I just didn't not want to hold you through all this and put you on a tripod and…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
m h's Presentation: take the camera.
Andrew Daniels: No, that's totally fine.
m h's Presentation: 
m h's Presentation: right. I get so good.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, no Okay, so I had just played with some numbers.
Andrew Daniels: What I didn't put in any of the growth or the value from whatever we're going to do for life insurance, Just because I don't know what kind of rating we're going to get. So, I want to wait on that. I don't want to promise you something that's not possible to get,…
Andrew Daniels: if that makes sense. so, I got both your applications, Kim. I was able to finagle it so we don't have to get a doctor's note or anything. So that's okay.
m h's Presentation: Bless your heart.
m h's Presentation: I was willing to give in on that.
Andrew Daniels: And We'll see what they come back with. totally fine. I get that. But something's going to be better than nothing. And we'll just work around it. That's totally fine. based on what I'm doing preliminary, I think you guys will be okay either way.
00:10:00
Andrew Daniels: So, the best case scenario is that you both get a really good rating and it gives us that extra efficiency. But one way or another, we'll figure it out. let me share this with you so you guys can see how I'm looking at it and then I'll show you some really fun fun numbers. I did put in some bare minimums just to kind of set stuff up. so we've got the 401k with Mark's Ford moving in storage.
Andrew Daniels: And is this zoomed in enough? Can you guys see that on the screen good enough or do I need to make it bigger? you can't see me. Okay, hold on.
m h's Presentation: I'm only seeing you.
m h's Presentation: I see you, but nothing else.
Andrew Daniels: Let me try and…
m h's Presentation: Which I'm not opposed to that.
Andrew Daniels: re Yeah,…
m h's Presentation: I'm just saying.
Andrew Daniels: no worries. let me see if I can unpin myself.
Andrew Daniels: minimize. Okay.
Andrew Daniels: All And do you have a presentation on there yet where you can see the numbers that I'm pulling up?
m h's Presentation: No, hang on.
m h's Presentation: Let me see. Do I need to get the computer out?
Andrew Daniels: What I'll do, What if I printed this out and…
m h's Presentation: We can do that.
Andrew Daniels: I'll send you a copy on your email? Then at the very least you guys can pull it up while we're talking. that way you've at least got something in there. give me two seconds. I'm going to print that out so I can send it to your email. about the social security, don't worry too much about that once you guys get access to that or whatever.
Andrew Daniels: we can get more clear on the numbers. I just went to the Social Security Administration website and did a quick calculation so that we can get just a generic idea of where we expect you guys to be and then we'll go from there. I got everything popping up on my screen. Holy cow. Two seconds here. It's all running away from me. I tell you, this technology is going to be the end of us here.
Andrew Daniels: We're either gonna I don't know.
m h's Presentation: And I'm sure you figure it out way faster than we do.
Andrew Daniels: I don't know what's gonna happen. Yeah, you guys did pretty good. It was only what five minutes before we got sound. I think that's pretty good in my book. All right, I'm just going to shoot this over to your email so you guys have it.
Andrew Daniels: And it's designed to be kind of a living document.
Andrew Daniels: As you guys do stuff as things come up as you have opportunities emergencies we're going to put it all into the analyzer and we'll make sure and keep track of it. give me two more seconds here because I'm going to get it over to There we go. Just so you have something to look at too while we're talking.
m h's Presentation: Okay, he's sending it to you.
m h's Presentation: even smaller than the last, I think. What is that? That's smaller than the last one. And I didn't get that invite to the link, so I don't know.
Andrew Daniels: Really? Okay. that's kind of strange.
Andrew Daniels: I don't know why I've had problems with my phone system today.
m h's Presentation: Holy moly. Really?
m h's Presentation: Yeah, that's probably $25 right there.
Andrew Daniels: I've had problems with the Google Meet. good And all And I'm going to send this to you and then we'll go over some highlights here because I think I put in some placeholders for the life insurance. Not much, but I think it'll show you kind of the power of what happens when we add that on top. And it's really just a multiplier on what we're already going to do. So, I'm not worried about it.
Andrew Daniels: I just want to get the right rates and then we'll be able to put exact numbers in there. okay,…
m h's Presentation: I'll move that stuff out of the chip if you want. Yeah, I'll just call it. Okay. Okay.
Andrew Daniels: I got that sent to your email. so first thing is I've got your 401k tracked and we can kind of talk about what you want to do there. Personally, I don't think you should put another dime in it, but if you're getting a match on it, I mean, that's free money and you can let that ride or you can take that for monthly cash flow. I know it's going around. huh
00:15:00
m h's Presentation: So, here's the real deal on that. And pardon my voice. I'm fighting off a cold, but I was putting zero dollars into their company matched product.
m h's Presentation: Then I got Hang on one second, Andrew. You got hurt?
Andrew Daniels: Yeah,…
Andrew Daniels: no worries.
m h's Presentation: I didn't get hurt. I ended up having an infection in my toe and the doctors decided they wanted to operate. they put me in the hospital first and…
Andrew Daniels: Right. figure it out.
m h's Presentation: they couldn't decide what they wanted to do. Long story short, I said, "Look, there's three of you. Come up with one idea. I don't care what it is, but you all agree on whatever it is we're going to do." And so they decided to operate.
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
m h's Presentation: While I was off work all last summer, I was on FMLA and I got paid.
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
m h's Presentation: And while I was getting paid,…
m h's Presentation: that's when they started their deductions into that. they volunteered me for it.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Wow.
m h's Presentation: And so shortly after that I got garnished and I mean they're already hitting my checks from two sides. What the hell? Okay, fine. So
Andrew Daniels: We can look at that, it might be the kind of thing Do you have the dollar amount of the garnishment that's going out right now?
Andrew Daniels: Do you know what it is out of every paycheck per paycheck?
m h's Presentation: I want to say 377,…
m h's Presentation: but hang on.
Andrew Daniels: Jesus. Yeah.
m h's Presentation: Yeah, they were serious when they decided they wanted their money.
m h's Presentation: I think that might be what that papus thing is so currently this Okay,…
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: We can look at maybe there are some ways that we can pay that lump sum off and just get it out of there. that might be relevant.
m h's Presentation: so we're starting a new year and I've had 37 7 out of this check. The total of year to date 755. the balance down here is 5236 which would coincide with the amount that I owe them. It was about $7,000. so if they've been hitting me every check for about …
m h's Presentation: because I talked to the accounting guy and he's like, "Look, dude, there's nothing I can do to stop this." And I said, how much is it that they're going to hit each check with?" He said, "About $400." So, that would kind of fall in line with what he had told me. So, I'm saying it's the Yes,…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. is that every two weeks?
Andrew Daniels: You get paid every two weeks.
m h's Presentation: Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: And there's only $5600 left.
Andrew Daniels: 5236. Okay.
m h's Presentation: 523 5236.
m h's Presentation: Yeah, pretty quick.
Andrew Daniels: They're gonna that'll be done pretty quick then. I mean,…
m h's Presentation: Yeah, pretty quick.
Andrew Daniels: down pretty fast. Yeah. that means you've got about 14 more payments on that. huh.
m h's Presentation: So, that'll take me just about to my birthday. Yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. all right. That's it.
Andrew Daniels: I mean that is and may be worth it to just let that pay off and let it complete the way that it does. You know what I mean? at this Gosh.
m h's Presentation: One less thing I have to worry about.
Andrew Daniels: So, I'm just going to capture that 37 It's not 37750. For 14 more every two weeks.
m h's Presentation: It's 37762 is what they took. It looks like they're taking every pay period.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. whatever.
Andrew Daniels: We'll get there. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11. Yep. About your birthday. 12, 13, 14. I'm gonna end it on August 15th. that's a little bit over, but that just covers any issues that might happen.
m h's Presentation: That's fine.
m h's Presentation: Mhm. Right.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah. Good grief. Okay. that is what it is.
m h's Presentation: Yep. We have a lot of it is…
Andrew Daniels: I don't know that. Yeah, we'll look at that. But now I've got it captured.
m h's Presentation: what it is.
m h's Presentation: It is. And to be honest, I not had this conver we not having this conversation with you, I've just got a big shovel handed to me.
00:20:00
Andrew Daniels: That's okay.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah. it's good to dig out of the hole, but I want to make sure that I think there's a way that you guys can get out of the hole and get on level even, …
m h's Presentation: All right.
Andrew Daniels: foundational ground and then we build from there. And here's kind of what I experience with people in your age group. I know you come to the table, it's like, man, we're so far behind. We didn't do what we're supposed to do. Life happened, emergencies came up. My neighbor needed something. you could do everything right and still end up in this position. And that's why I like doing this is because you don't have to accept just, keeping your nose right above the water anymore.
Andrew Daniels: And especially with this gift, you're not going to have to do that for too much longer. but I want to make sure we have that out capture just in case if there's something we can do to make it more efficient. I want to be able to look at that. so I do have that. I don't have a problem. They are doing a contribution on top of what you're doing. So, not the end of the world. I know last time did we talk about when you would want to retire,…
Andrew Daniels: when you're wanting to be done for them? I know it's like yesterday. Yeah. Right.
m h's Presentation: last year,…
m h's Presentation: 10 years ago, I've been saying retirement isn't biblical. I'm going to work till I die. now I don't honestly know…
Andrew Daniels: Right. Right. Yeah.
m h's Presentation: how much longer they're going to pay me to do nothing. And I'm not mad at him because, when God blesses you, he blesses you for a season. And it's not a permanent blessing.
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
m h's Presentation: And so, I've been blessed pretty well where I'm at down there, even though it sucks so bad. They suck so bad. But in my personal case, I don't have to work for the money that I'm getting. So, it's a blessing. How long that will last,…
Andrew Daniels: Right. Okay.
m h's Presentation: 
m h's Presentation: I don't know. As far as when I want to retire, I've never even given that a thought.
Andrew Daniels: And I think that's okay. I have people at all different mindsets about that. I'm kind of with you. I don't think anybody really retires. what I find happens is they don't want to keep doing what they're doing. They want choices and flexibility. and that's really what I think we can give that to you. Would it be unreasonable for me to plan on five years at pretty much the income that you're at and then having a evaluation at that point?
m h's Presentation: Five years is going to put me at retirement…
m h's Presentation: because the social security has me retiring at 70.
Andrew Daniels: right now.
Andrew Daniels: We may look at social security and…
m h's Presentation: You could get fired.
Andrew Daniels: decide to take it earlier, take it later.
Andrew Daniels: I want to do the mathematical optimization of what's going to put the most money in your pocket dayto day.
m h's Presentation: So, right,…
m h's Presentation: I appreciate that. So, I've been told by a friend of mine who's a few years ahead of me,…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Right. Right.
m h's Presentation: he's like, "Dude, you need to retire now." And I'm thinking to myself, "But I'm giving up $1,000 a month if I go now, but if by some kind of Andy magic I'm able to replace that thousand dollars. He might be on point with something because I've got shelves and…
m h's Presentation: shadow boxes in my little shop right now that I would just love to give my full attention to,…
Andrew Daniels: tinker around.
Andrew Daniels: And that's the other thing, too, is it's not like you're going from doing the work for Ford to doing nothing. you both have something that you could continue to be productive and…
m h's Presentation: right? Right,…
Andrew Daniels: generative and keep your minds and your bodies engaged where you're not just going to rot away sitting in the recliner. I love that for you.
m h's Presentation: right, right,…
Andrew Daniels: Retool, don't retire. right.
m h's Presentation: right, right, right.
Andrew Daniels: But we do have to be cognizant of the fact that it may take some time to build up a significant amount of revenue from that. You're going to have to figure that out. And of course, I will obviously work through that with you.
Andrew Daniels: The other thing to consider is if we take social security while you're still working before what they call your full retirement age, which Mark for you, your full retirement age actually for both of you is 67 years old, And so if you take social security before then, they will rate down your social security for every $2 you make over 22,000, they'll take $1 away from your social security check. that's not permanent. That's just while you're working and…
m h's Presentation: while I'm working.
Andrew Daniels: then they'll give it back, once you're done. So, it might even be relevant for us to say, two years and six months until you're 67, right? yeah,…
00:25:00
m h's Presentation: All right. Okay.
Andrew Daniels: that's Two years and six months. What if we put the target date there? And I'm not saying retirement in the sense that you're done working, but just in our software, when can we stop counting on that money and maybe start counting on the other money that comes in?
Andrew Daniels: And so I think I'm kind of targeting a two and a half to fiveyear window where we say at some point in that window, depending on what kinds of things you guys do between now and then, you will be able to say to Ford, "Thanks so much, but you can no longer afford me. I'm out." Right? Okay, that's good. so, let's see.  I did a couple of things on the expenses that we talked about and some of these are just based on my experience with, working with people at all different age groups. I put an end date on your mortgage because that expense isn't going to be forever. At some point, it will be completely paid off. And so that's not going to and I also zeroed out the inflation. That 573, that's just the principal and interest. It's going to stay at 573 and mortgage is paid off.
Andrew Daniels: So, if we didn't do that, the software would assume that the 573 grows by two or three% every year, and that's not really accurate. So, …
Andrew Daniels: I zeroed out inflation on some of the things that didn't make sense. I also rated down your food expenditures after age 85. Generally, when people get over age 85, they're not eating quite as much as they did in their 60s, right? …
m h's Presentation: Yeah. Yeah.
m h's Presentation: I'll give you that one.
Andrew Daniels: and then I've got a basic assumption for your Medicare's part B and D. And then we can talk more about whenever it's time to hop on the advantage plans. which probably won't be until after you're done working because you get good insurance now. but you are coming up on getting your part I think it's the part A. no, I'm sorry. It's the part B and D at 65.
Andrew Daniels: So, in the next couple of months, I did have another couple of clients that I was talking to and they said, "Andy, would you just help us with the Medicare part? We don't want to get taken advantage of. We don't want somebody that doesn't know our situation." And I said, "Okay, I will go get my license for you by March 31st." And they thought I was joking,…
m h's Presentation: I already did.
Andrew Daniels: but I'm serious. I've had enough people ask me now "Okay, fine. Let me go get licensed so I can at least evaluate plans for people." So after March, if you guys want me to, I can also help you with that and I'll get licensed on that and everything and then we can figure that part out. So because I've had enough people be like, "Andy, could you just take care of it for me?" I "I'm not licensed. I really can't, but I'll go get it, I guess." So, I put a set aside of $30,000. I think we talked about 20,000 and 13,000 for the s, for your truck and for your son.
Andrew Daniels: And I think for now it's good enough to just say, "Hey, you take that and do what you need to do with that to get your vehicle situation figured out." And then we can optimize on Kim's car. And I think there's a way we can do that smart where you guys don't have to engage outside financing. You don't have to waste cash on it.
Andrew Daniels: But if you need a truck, your son needs a truck, let's just get that taken care of Okay, perfect. I figured. So there we go. I already got that taken out and set aside. and then we just put the garnishment in there.
m h's Presentation: I already have it in the driveway.
Andrew Daniels: Any other things that are going out right now that we didn't cover?
m h's Presentation: …
m h's Presentation: in concert with the garnishment, both of us have judgments and I've got, couple of them knocking on my emails pretty regular.  And I said, "Look, cuz now my brother's threatening to take me to court." And so I don't know what's going to transpire there, but I told them come the end of this month that I would take care of that and it's a couple thousand dollars. so I have a couple of them that are like that. They're 2,000
m h's Presentation: both of them and the rest of them they've already went to court got judgments they're not talking to me right now and…
Andrew Daniels: Okay. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: Okay. …
m h's Presentation: so I'll revisit them at a later date…
Andrew Daniels: are they emailing you?
m h's Presentation: but the collection agencies for the two currently are we haven't gone to judgment on I haven't given out per se personal information only that they will I haven't spoke to anyone…
Andrew Daniels: Are they call? Okay, first things first. Do not answer any phone calls or give out any personal information over the phone ever again. Never. Anybody that's trying to collect anything from you ever. when they call, they say, "Is this Mark Howard?" Okay, Good.
00:30:00
m h's Presentation: but I emailed them back a response to their email to me and…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, one of the things that happens is you can lose a lot of the protections that we have federally with federal law,…
m h's Presentation: that hey be patient I'll get you quick as I  Yeah,
Andrew Daniels: with Fair Debt Collections Practices, Fair Credit Reporting Act. If you talk to them on the phone, you implicitly give up your federal protections and the fines that they will get if they violate those protections. So talking to them on the phone, big We want to do everything through the letter. One of the things I'm going to do is we need to set up a meeting with this debt resolution company and…
m h's Presentation: All
Andrew Daniels: get all of that under one umbrella so that you don't have to deal with that anymore. And it may still end up that we have to pay something to the collections.
Andrew Daniels: But if it's in collections, that is a huge opportunity because nine times out of 10, those collections agencies will not have the proper documentation to be able to legally collect on that debt. So, what they're doing right now is they're strongarmming you because they purchased a thousand accounts because you responded,…
m h's Presentation: All right.
Andrew Daniels: that means they got a live fish on the hook. Does that make sense?
m h's Presentation: Okay. Okay.
Andrew Daniels: It's totally normal to do what you did. You didn't do anything wrong, but from now on, don't answer any phone calls. We're going to prioritize for both of you getting that debt resolution company in the middle of these conversations because they will track every single violation, every phone call, every email that was not supposed to happen. They'll track all of that and we're going to turn around and strongarm them right back. so, I'm going to make a note of that and I'll get a referral out right away for that. because yeah, you guys shouldn't be having to deal with that. a lot of it is just junk collectors.
Andrew Daniels: They don't even know what they're supposed to be doing to be legal and they're thugs for lack of a better term. Exactly. But they're unregulated. There's at least the banks have,…
Andrew Daniels: people coming in checking their s*** every once in a while. these debt collectors. I mean, you and I could start a debt collection business and go rough people up and, most people wouldn't even know the difference whether we are allowed to do it or not. So, I have a pretty bright line, no holds barred for anybody that's a debt collector. Kind of like a screw Get out of here. you're not following the law and I'll just need to prove it and…
m h's Presentation: Okay.
Andrew Daniels: you guys can go pound sand.
Andrew Daniels: So, I want to take that stresser right off your plate. First off, you're not going to have to pay full dollar for any of that Maybe the judgments because it's already gone past that point, but anything before that, we need to get as much documentation about who's knocking on your door right now and get it over to the resolution company. They'll get in the middle of it and they'll say, "We are dealing with this now.
m h's Presentation: I don't know. Right.
Andrew Daniels: If you want to talk to Mark or Kim, You have to talk to us." And if they try to talk to you guys, it'll be a $5,000 fine. And it won't from our company. It'll be from the federal government. So they can deal with the government on that. Everybody loves that, right? okay.
m h's Presentation: Okay.
m h's Presentation: Yeah. Mhm.
Andrew Daniels: So, I think we got all the details in here. one of the big things, Kim, were you able to pull up that document? Did you get an email from me? Okay.
Andrew Daniels: So I've got some of the basics in there that you guys will see if you go to look at near the last page. see if I can get it pulled back up here. Where is my Sorry, I lost my PDF reader program on one of my windows.
Andrew Daniels: Give me a second. There it is. I got it. So, like I said, this is a living document.
m h's Presentation: No, you're fine.
Andrew Daniels: I know you guys probably just been in the grind of life for so many years that you can't believe it but there will be things that you're going to come back to me over the next couple of years as we get this system set up and you say hey we really want to do this or like you told me last time we want to give an extra couple hundred dollars and so at church or whatever those kinds of things are going to come up and I love that that's on your heart and we'll plan for some of that the first couple of pages are just about your assets some of the
Andrew Daniels: that we've already gone through. if you go to page number eight, right, and this was a very quick and dirty because I want to get the life insurance numbers in there.
m h's Presentation: AJ, now you got to work it.
Andrew Daniels: Based on the moves that we're going to do at Kim's age of 100 and Mark's age 104, you guys should have about $1.5 million of spendable liquid assets.
00:35:00
Andrew Daniels: Let's see.
m h's Presentation: So, I'm looking at cash flows. If you want to go to where it would show my age, that was like page nine or 10. Nine there.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, it's right towards the back. I think it's the second to last page.
m h's Presentation: Is that the one where it says my age?
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, it has the year 2061 Kim.
m h's Presentation: Yeah, I got you.
Andrew Daniels: So, the protected asset is just a 2 and a.5% inflation. The only thing you've got under the protected asset is your home value. And then I added what I did was I said, "What if we just spun off and we could only do $10,000 into each of your policies?" Now, likely we'll be able to grow that a little bit faster, but I want it to be based on your rating.
Andrew Daniels: But I said, "What if we just sent $10,000 to each policy and called that that was all we were allowed to do, I'm basically hedging on the worst case underwriting scenario." the rest of the Go ahead.
m h's Presentation: No, no, I'm listening.
Andrew Daniels: The rest of those spendable assets, right? Those are your That's that 300,000. if we can go get a guaranteed income off of that, that's what that can grow to at your current level of spending after getting the truck for you and your son. and that's where that will go. So, what that tells me and here's how to think about this. Yes, you guys this is illustrated out to age 100. What most people do is they say, we'd like to spend some of that money before we get to age 100." Right?
Andrew Daniels: and that's totally possible. I think what our number one goal is with given what you have now, if we put this money into a secured investment, we know the principal is going to be there. We're going to get an income off of this every year every month. Will there be enough? And I think it to have a one and a half mill$ one and a half million dollars at age 100. There's definitely going to be enough for you guys to do some fun stuff between ages 60 and 70, right? And so that's what we want to know.
Andrew Daniels: then the question is, what do you want to do in the next 10 years? We could spend some of that income off to get your woodworking business going. We could, start to do some more of those fun things. and so broad picture, doing these moves is going to be enough. Then the question is, what are you guys going to need sooner than that? Is it going to change the end result? Absolutely. you may want to say, and this is just I know you guys wouldn't do this, but buy a $200,000 boat. that's going to change things at a hundred, but will the money still last? And those are the questions we need. It may not be that extreme, but this is the framework. This is what I'll use when we say, "Okay, Kim, time for you to get a new car. How are we going to do that? And how's that going to affect this 1.5?" it may go down to 1.53 instead of 1.55. That's totally worth it. Let's get Kim a car by August, And we'll let the system get up to speed a little bit. Let everything get settled out.
Andrew Daniels: five months from now, whatever it might be. Let's get Kim that car. And from here on out, the way that you guys buy cars is going to be completely different than you've ever done because we're going to make sure that every dime that somebody else would have taken from you purchasing that car,…
m h's Presentation: really Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: we're going to move that money from your left pocket to your right pocket and it'll just go back into your own system now and you'll have the money and the car. Yes. And that's because of how we're going to set up these policies be at the beginning at the front end. any questions so one of the things that I did not do, so when we are you able to see my screen yet at all or still not? no worries. when you log into that analyzer, when you get into there, you'll see a section.
Andrew Daniels: There's a pre-retirement on the financial plan and there's a On the retirement side, currently I have some negative monthly numbers and that can freak people out quite a bit. So, for example, look at, when Kim is 66 and Mark is 70, it shows us that we're going backwards, we're under income by about $2,500 a month.  And that trend continues all the way until you guys are 85 till Kim's 85 and Mark's 89. But the interesting thing is that asset balance is still growing from the 300,000 up to the 1.5.
00:40:00
Andrew Daniels: So, for example, Kim, when you're 70 and Mark, when you're 74, let's say at 66 and 70, you might be overspending by two $2,500 a month, but your total capital grows by about $10,000 a year regardless. You'll still have $10,000 a year more every year than you had the year before, even though you had to take money out of that.
Andrew Daniels: And so by the time you're 80, instead of having $460,000, you've got $550. You've grown by $100,000 in a 10-year period. And you still have taken all that income to be able to live on and cover your expenses.
Andrew Daniels: Is that well and…
m h's Presentation: I'll take you at your word.
m h's Presentation: What do you mean?
Andrew Daniels: we'll work through that and what I'm doing is hedging on and just conceptually is that okay to do can we cover all your expenses and give you more money than you had the previous year. if we make sure that all your expenses are covered with enough income and then we grow your assets, whatever you have saved, we'll grow your savings by another $10,000 and…
Andrew Daniels: cover all the expenses. I don't know. Some people say, "No, I don't want to do that." You would be surprised.
m h's Presentation: Yeah, that's a no-brainer.
m h's Presentation: That's a brainer. Yeah. If I can cover everything that I need covered and…
Andrew Daniels: I actually Yes.
m h's Presentation: still get 10 grand. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: And I had a lady who got started with me two years ago and she was checking her accounts the other day and she's like, "Wait a minute. There's $30,000 more than there was, last time I checked this. what's happening?" And I'm like, "I'm sorry. Did your stock guy not promise you that there would be more money every time you looked?" Because that's what I do. I like doing that because it makes it easy. Then we can plan for emergencies. Then we can plan for opportunities.  So, the way that we do this that I have this set up is, let's see. We've got the 353. we took out the 20 and the 13. so what I would say is I want to leave you guys with a little bit of a buffer. So, you like 34, why don't we just leave the 34 there and start getting an income off of the 300,000.
Andrew Daniels: this is guys get an this is why it works out so well. That amounts to an extra $2,000 per month. some of that will need to route through the policy, but remember, this is not like a homeowner's insurance or an auto insurance policy. You're not sending it out never to have access to it. I want you to think of it like this.  You're taking money from your always taxable left pocket and putting it into your never taxable right pocket. So then when you need access to it, just like a savings account, we'll just call them up, say, "Hey, we need money. Send it to our account. It'll be there in three days." Great. They never ask questions about, sending it back or anything like that. This puts you guys in the driver's seat, not just to smooth out the emergencies, but then there's going to be some opportunities as we grow the system. I'll probably call you up.
Andrew Daniels: we'll do these we'll check in every six months or so. And I'll say, "Hey, you guys have got some capital accumulating here. We should really look at doing this with it so you can go get more money." As we do that, I expect this 1.5 that you'll have at age 100 or…
Andrew Daniels: let's put it in more real numbers. when Mark is 85 and Kim is 81, it's at about What was that?
m h's Presentation: I hope it's not that way.
m h's Presentation: Really? She's like, " you said 100." She said, "I hope to not live that long." And then she's like, "Then you said 81." And she's like, "I don't want to live that long."  on the mic. Really?
Andrew Daniels: Let's back it off. When Kim's 81 and Mark is 85, you guys will have $586,000 if we do nothing else.
Andrew Daniels: you'll still have a cool half million dollars in the bank to do whatever you want with plus all your expenses covered. I expect that number to be much larger. And I let's just say that it's 15% larger. Now, that's a gross underestimation,…
Andrew Daniels: But let's just say it's a $100,000. This is 20% larger. I think we can get a 20% bump on all of that over the next 15 years by what we do with the money as it grows. But I'm not going to illustrate that now because we don't have that now. All we have is what we have now. Does that make sense? Sure.
00:45:00
m h's Presentation: And let me pause for a moment and back up just a little bit to the 300,000 because this was something that came up in discussion after our conversation initially…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Mhm.
m h's Presentation: because I was it came to light that perhaps the buffer let's say that I started with a trimmed that 300 back. H how is that going to look down the road? And is that going to adversely affect me? if I step 25 and went in with 275, you know what I'm saying? How is that going to affect me down the road?
m h's Presentation: And if I went all in with the three, how and because you said that I'm taking it from one pocket to the next if something came up…
m h's Presentation: because Taylor hasn't got his truck. And if I do tap that truck, that leaves 15, which is way more than I've ever had before, which I'm okay with. But there are voices near me that think that maybe they should be larger.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Mhm.
m h's Presentation: And then again too, like I said, I don't know how this is going to come out with my brother. he wants eight grand or he's taking me to court. And I'm like, let's go. I haven't been to a good dance in a long time to pay his divorce attorney.
Andrew Daniels: He wants So he wants $8,000.
m h's Presentation: And I'm like, how does your divorce have anything to do with the sale of this farm and…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Why would Yeah.
m h's Presentation: the estate? And you want that eight grand out of my half. Let's go dance. We're going to charge them because here's kind of the deal, Andy. So,…
m h's Presentation: my mom's attorney has written a few what do you call them? FSAs, family settlement, agreements.
Andrew Daniels: Right.
m h's Presentation: The current one that's signed and notorized has him paying all the expenses including the 2% of the sale for me for the IPR.
Andrew Daniels: But he signed it.
m h's Presentation: He thinks that's b******* because I didn't do nothing for that. I think it's a b****** you screwed my mother. But it's signed and…
Andrew Daniels: It's already done.
m h's Presentation: notorized. So,…
Andrew Daniels: I guess he think what he wants about it.
m h's Presentation: exactly. and…
Andrew Daniels: God.
m h's Presentation: and I just text him, because he told me, "Oh s***, we just passed the deadline." Okay, Friday at five o'clock, I had till Friday at five to either pay him that $8,000 or…
m h's Presentation: he was going to tell his lawyer to proceed. And I'm like, "Good. tick tock. Let's go to a dance." Okay, exactly. and…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
m h's Presentation: I said, "You better want to get a hold of your So, the new agreement that my mom's attorney wrote up that was to be signed and notorized was going to go to probate." So, the judge could see that even though my mom's will says divided equally, that because of the situation, this is how the funds were to be dispersed.
Andrew Daniels: Right. Yeah.
m h's Presentation: and he wouldn't sign it unless I had him rewrite it. And I'm not doing that, And so in that final agreement, it says that neither party can pursue the other.
Andrew Daniels: And he already signed that one.
m h's Presentation: No. So…
Andrew Daniels: Okay.
m h's Presentation: since he didn't sign that one and the one we have that's signed and notorized has no mention of pursuing the other, I told him, "Dude, Tell your ex-wife because we're all going to court because I'm going to sue you for the money you took from mom.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah.
m h's Presentation: My lawyer fees and pain and fraud, pain and suffering, taking our farm.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Right.
m h's Presentation: If you want to go to court, we're going all in. So, I don't know.
Andrew Daniels: She might not get her $8,000 or…
m h's Presentation: I may have to No,…
Andrew Daniels: he might I do.
m h's Presentation: but what I'm saying is I may have to dip into that to pay the lawyer. You follow me? But the backside of that can look a lot different…
Andrew Daniels: What do we
m h's Presentation: because there's the possibility of a couple hundred,000 because I know for a fact of just my own simple con calculations my brothers got 90 grand from her that she would have never wrote.
00:50:00
Andrew Daniels: But does he have the money to pay it back?
m h's Presentation: Here's kind of the way I see this.
Andrew Daniels: Does that make sense? does he even have it to you?
m h's Presentation: Yes. check this out.
m h's Presentation: So, if the state finds for me, isn't the state going to pay me and him and make him pay the state?
Andrew Daniels: I wouldn't assume that.
Andrew Daniels: Did your attorney tell you that?
m h's Presentation: No. …
Andrew Daniels: I mean, that would be the case in child support or probably specific types of family arrangements, I would guess, that have to do with dependency where they can do that.
Andrew Daniels: But between two adults, I don't know that the state's going to be the gonna be left holding the bag of somebody not paying. Does that make sense? I would think be very sensitive to that.
m h's Presentation: yeah, it does. But nonetheless, I think he could be There you go.
Andrew Daniels: You could get a judgment issued against him where they garnish his wages for the next 20 years and get your $100,000 back that way,…
m h's Presentation: I don't care…
Andrew Daniels: right? Yeah.
m h's Presentation: 
m h's Presentation: how it works. And he may I don't know that they put him in jail, but fraud is illegal.
Andrew Daniels: What happened there might be called fraudulent transfer. And that's probably the word you want to bring up with your lawyer is ask him if there's fraudulent transfer applies to what he did with the deeds.
m h's Presentation: Not just much that her checking account. I've got checks…
m h's Presentation: where okay as her power of attorney my brother would sign a blank check and give it to his wife and…
Andrew Daniels: .
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah.
m h's Presentation: she would do whatever with it.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Definitely fraud.
m h's Presentation: I've got a couple of them that are thousands of dollars transferred from my mom's into account. One that they wrote with your name. But they even signed my name on one of them.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Really?
m h's Presentation: So that's what I'm saying. There's $90,000 worth of stuff like that that they've embezzled from my mom.
Andrew Daniels: Dude,…
m h's Presentation: And that's only the few years that I can see. Was three quarters of a million dollars.
Andrew Daniels: I didn't know about this deadline.
Andrew Daniels: Otherwise, dude, I would call your lawyer and…
Andrew Daniels: I'd tell your lawyer to offer $6,000 right now One of the terms of the settlement, he signs Offer him six grand. Say, "This is what you're going to get or we can all go to court and you can waste all this money that I know you don't have." I will make it back for you tenfold. I would pay him and get it out. I know it feels like extortion. You'll be so happy to be done with it and make sure that your lawyer has it tied up…
m h's Presentation: I'd rather fight him. I got to smoke from that.
Andrew Daniels: where he cannot come after you for another dime and say, "Get out of my life. This is what you Go away." And then I will make you the rest of it tenfold. And he can watch you guys flourish and be in whatever hole he wants to be in. I would buy. This is the deal or…
m h's Presentation: You sound like my That's kind of…
Andrew Daniels: no deal.
m h's Presentation: what my mom's attorney was kind of hinting at. I just can't tell you…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. …
Andrew Daniels: and I think he's a good attorney if he hinted at that for you because as pain Yeah.
m h's Presentation: how bad that goes against my grain.
Andrew Daniels: You know what the best revenge though is? winning so hard that he's like, "Wait a minute. I know how." He doesn't know what I know. And I guarantee you five years from now, he's gonna look at your guys' lifestyle and go, "How the hell are they doing that? What? They didn Did they get more money than I thought?" He's gonna be wondering, "What the flip happened?"
Andrew Daniels: But my number one concern is that when is because I had this happen in my family and what I had to do and I think what some of my family members did and what some of them did not do were very different. Some of them wanted to go head on and…
Andrew Daniels: it cost a lot of money and it cost a lot of things and the relationship it's soured. Yeah, it's soured and gone. There's no reason you need to sour the money that your mom intended for you to flourish with your life with him any further.
m h's Presentation: It's been toast for years.
Andrew Daniels: And if you have to pay him eight. But if you can tell your lawyer to offer him six, he's a snake.
00:55:00
Andrew Daniels: that your brother sounds like he's doing sneaky s** stuff. If he wants you to pay something fine, offer him six and say you can take six now or you can spend 25 $30,000 of our mom's money again and maybe he knows he doesn't have it.  So you got all the power here and the power here that you want to take is to end this and end it permanently for the forever cuz otherwise your ability to be happy to enjoy what you've got to have the Ford having them pay you to do a pretty easy job to focus on your woodworking business to get a truck for your son to enjoy these golden years with Kim your ability
m h's Presentation: They don't have it though.
Andrew Daniels: ability to even enjoy all of that even…
m h's Presentation: My house,…
Andrew Daniels: if you have the money to spend it that you're not going to enjoy it while you're in a fight with your brother constantly being reminded.
m h's Presentation: that's not happening. Thank you.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, constantly being reminded. I wouldn't want that for you. I'll tell you this. I won't tell you what to do, but I will tell you even if you had to give them every penny of the $8,000, I'll make you a 40% increase on what's left every five years without fail until both of you are dead. And you'll look ridiculous to him. He'll get his $8,000. Hold on. You got 334. Let's just do this, Minus $8,000. Let's take out the 15 or so for the truck on just that alone. Let's see. That's 25 grand a year. For the next five years, that's 125 grand.
Andrew Daniels: another five years on that is another hund that's $250,000 over the next 10 years for $8,000 of expense…
Andrew Daniels: and whatever your peace of mind is worth right and I don't mean peace of mind and saying I was right he was wrong we got vindicated by the courts we don't need the courts you don't need to pay lawyers and pay the court to know that what he did was wrong we got a judge that's going to decide that eternally anyways that's not your concern,…
m h's Presentation: Yeah. That's true,…
m h's Presentation: Yeah,…
Andrew Daniels: That's not for you to take on and that's not for you to pay lawyers to help you decide. We don't have to worry about whether or not he's going to get judged.
m h's Presentation: me too.
Andrew Daniels: That's my opinion, But I'll help you do it however you want. I think we can make it work either way.
Andrew Daniels: I think for the peace of mind though, you can't buy peace of mind that you're going to have knowing it's done. You can't buy it. It's more valuable than the $8,000. Yeah. No, that's fine. Yeah, we're not in a rush here. because yeah these things this is just the stuff of life
Andrew Daniels: Hey, right.
m h's Presentation: I mean,…
m h's Presentation: it's like her lawyer said, "Not trying to rack up more fees with you. I'm already long as it is." meaning that he's done little more than what he's charged for and he's wanted it done for me as well as for himself.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah.
m h's Presentation: And he hasn't responded to either of my emails. So, I'm thinking he's really hoping that I don't know what he's thinking, but he hasn't responded yet. So, I guess that gives me time to think about it. But I may offer him a subsequent amount to be done with it.
Andrew Daniels: I would say settle because you're the one with the big stick. You got you you are right.
m h's Presentation: And I don't want to either,…
Andrew Daniels: You are like I could tell it.
Andrew Daniels: Anybody that sees the story can tell it. I don't want you to spend $50,000 to prove that you're right.
m h's Presentation: but …
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. I know,…
m h's Presentation: but know this. I would
Andrew Daniels: You know what? I think you should gather your family and the ones that you care about and who care about you and who are relying on you and you should make such a big win in the second half of your life that it makes his shenanigans look stupid and silly and he's going to call you up 10 years from now and go did you take extra money? How are you living this lifestyle? And you go what it is. I guess God provides and God takes away. So that's how we all got to live.
Andrew Daniels: Hope you make your choices right.
m h's Presentation: I can almost promise you this,…
m h's Presentation: Andy, because he didn't know where my house was when he brought up this agreement that we had signed and notorized. the lady who runs the bank is notary that we bank at.
01:00:00
Andrew Daniels: Mhm. Okay.
m h's Presentation: She lives actually right behind me. She's in my backyard. And so we went to her house and had it notorized. But we've been here seven almost going on eight years. And my brother' call We don't have per se a relationship. So for he's not going to call me 10 years from now. I promise you he's not going to get two f**** what we're doing. He's like, "Give me that eight grand and we'll go our separate ways." We've already gone our separate ways. But that a grand hurts.
Andrew Daniels: It is.
m h's Presentation: Here's the upside to that. I may offer him half of that and…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. I don't think it's about being a big person.
m h's Presentation: where he's at. But I'm a big person. I'm not that big a person. it is about peace of mind.
Andrew Daniels: I think it's just the numbers. It's for you.
m h's Presentation: And it's kind of like forgiving. When you forgive someone, you don't forgive them for them. You forgive them for you because God forgives you in the manner in which you forgive.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Right. Right.
m h's Presentation: And I don't want to stand it in front of the judgment throne and have this thrown at me.
Andrew Daniels: you got what you got and then you still had to get more or something like that. We don't want that's and that's not healthy for you. And I think Yeah.
m h's Presentation: And that's kind of the point I was going to, Andy, is you forgive someone for your peace of mind for so that you can get that off you because when you hold all that animosity, you actually are giving them power over you.
Andrew Daniels: And you just want to say to him, "All right, dude. You have no power over me. Go do your thing." And you know what?
m h's Presentation: Yeah. Not…
Andrew Daniels: You don't need to drink poison and expect someone else to die.
Andrew Daniels: That's not how we're gonna do this.
m h's Presentation: how it works, right?
Andrew Daniels: But no, I understand how hard it is and I get And almost this exact same thing happened in my family where they couldn't agree on who did the right thing. And I still don't know. It's murkier. There was not really a clear line between what was supposed to have been done and what did get done. But they duped it out anyways. And they took $4 million down to$2 million real fast. I mean 18 months though both those lawyers got $2 million and
Andrew Daniels: they split it between them and they were happy with the results. so I would not suggest that to anybody. And you don't have a lot that you have to hold on to. The relationship like you said is not there. It's not like you're trying to save one of the most important Yeah. Yeah.
m h's Presentation: I bet they were.
m h's Presentation: Patch something up.
Andrew Daniels: I mean, and that is what it is, and that's sad, and we can mourn that. I think if you had to mourn that with an extra …
Andrew Daniels: just doing 275 versus 300 at the beginning, if I just change that number real quick, the number goes from 1.5 at 100 to 620.
m h's Presentation: Wow.
Andrew Daniels: And if we back it off to age 81 and 85, it goes from the 580 to 288.
Andrew Daniels: And so that's the difference in compound interest. if I change it to just decrease it by $8,000, right?
m h's Presentation: Wow, that's a huge difference.
Andrew Daniels: All things being equal. Hold on a second. It's calculating. Let's see what Come on. That change puts it at 1 point 1.35. Right. So $200,000 at age 100.  There's still some things I'm going to do to catch that up. So, even if you change it to 275, I could still catch it up in other ways. I'm not worried about that. and age 81 and 85. Now, we're still at 450 instead of 500. So, $8,000 is nothing out of your pocket today. And we'll make it back up in a ton of other ways financially, but you'll make it back up by being able to cut that cord and never looking back.
Andrew Daniels: I think that's more valuable than a million dollars any day of the week.
01:05:00
m h's Presentation: So, I got a crop check coming that's the last yield from the crops that we had a farmer and…
Andrew Daniels: Do they have stuff on the farm that they sold off at? Okay. Oh.
m h's Presentation: they sharecropped it basically and my mom it gets a third and so I reached out to him to make sure because he last checked he mailed to my brother and I wasn't want that to happen.
Andrew Daniels: Uh-huh. Okay.
m h's Presentation: And so because I have this account set up in the estate of my mom, he's going to send me that check, which I kind of anticipated it being here today, but it should be here.
m h's Presentation: If not tomorrow, then early next week. But at any rate, it's going to be equal to what my brother's wanting.
Andrew Daniels: Maybe he's just trying to play.
Andrew Daniels: Maybe he knows…
Andrew Daniels: how much is coming from that and he's just trying to grab that as one last thing. Yeah. Yeah. geez Louise. what a sucker. I don't like people like that.
m h's Presentation: That could be too.
m h's Presentation: And it wouldn't just And he's been standing on street corners preaching Jesus for 30 years.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, but not living it clearly.
m h's Presentation: And that's Yeah. If you ever go to Westport or the plaza, you'll see him.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah, he does that then.
m h's Presentation: Yeah. Has for 30 years.
Andrew Daniels: My Okay. yeah. we don't know.
m h's Presentation: Exactly.
Andrew Daniels: We don't know what's in the inside of people until they act.
m h's Presentation: Nope. I do too.
Andrew Daniels: And I think his actions have spoken loud enough for centuries. And like I said, I'll do it however you guys want. I think no matter what you decide to do, we're going to optimize as best we can and we'll get it rolling to the point that you're going to have some real options So it's okay either way. I think if your lawyer's costs get upwards of $100,000, let me know because that significantly changes the game plan.
m h's Presentation: going to significantly change. why can't he pay for a lawyer and…
m h's Presentation: let's not pay for a lawyer and him see what he can get? You still got to pay the lawyer up front.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. I mean,…
Andrew Daniels: that's the thing is even…
m h's Presentation: Why do we got to get a lawyer?
Andrew Daniels: if they come at you.
m h's Presentation: You can't go to court without a lawyer. I'm not going to go to court without a lawyer. I'm gonna go with Right.
Andrew Daniels: No. she's saying make him pay for a lawyer to even file the action.
m h's Presentation: Hes going to in the judgment is where we're going to get him to pay for our attorney.
Andrew Daniels: But that's a long process and you still got to pay a lawyer along the way.
m h's Presentation: Yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: And then it just draws it out like that might not be 12 or 15 months from now. you guys have to deal with that. I want to start making you money and…
m h's Presentation: Yeah. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: then I want to let you enjoy that money. That's what you need to do. you got to have some enjoyment.
m h's Presentation: Cuz you don't think about it, baby. more. I'm thinking about this. So, we do get Aaron. So, we win. But it's like Andy just said, 18 months that drug on. it's not very long time, but that's having this b*** on the tip of our tongue for 18 months. I can't even relate to that,…
Andrew Daniels: really start to like that.
m h's Presentation: It just can't.
Andrew Daniels: I Yeah.
m h's Presentation: I've worked so hard my whole life and I would put things back when we go shopping.  I would put things back because as long as my kids and my wife and my family's covered, I don't need that today. And I would set it back. I just can't relate to this. I just can't
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. It'll come.
Andrew Daniels: It'll happen. It doesn't And I said, we don't have to do all of this tonight. I think there's an adjustment period where you'll start to feel a little bit differently. The money's going to come in. It'll be fun for a while. And you go, okay, it's really coming in every month. okay, it does. And I've got people who are seven years in and they're like, I just am so amazed still that it comes every month. It's great when we set it up the right way from the beginning. I love that. And I want you guys to be so over the moon.  five years from now that it's even better than what I'm projecting. I'm trying to I want to put the bare minimum on here so that we can Yeah. Yeah.
01:10:00
m h's Presentation: having this homicide in our life has affected our perspective on life. And with that said,…
m h's Presentation: it's like mama just said, you're talking about five years from now might be in a car wreck tomorrow,…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah.
m h's Presentation: .
Andrew Daniels: It's not guaranteed.
m h's Presentation: Today. Tomorrow is not promised. And so I get the frailty of life. But you live for today,…
m h's Presentation: plan for tomorrow, and pray to God that when he's done using you, that it's down the road.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah.
m h's Presentation: But you have to You can't just live for today. We have to plan for tomorrow.
Andrew Daniels: And…
m h's Presentation: We're prepared.
Andrew Daniels: I said, I think most people when I show those numbers because I mean everything we do is contractual, so why wouldn't it be there at 103?
Andrew Daniels: I go out that far because I have seen people live longer than they expect. but I also think we're going to have lots of conversations where we look at that number and we'll probably grow. it'll edge up. it'll start at 1.5 and then we'll do some things over the next few years. Hey guys, now it's at 1.7. And what starts to happen is as you guys become acclimated to kind of the new way of income that comes in, you'll say, we'd really love to take a trip to Branson. It's just been a while. was take the kids and…
Andrew Daniels: go down to Branson and Can we Andy, what if we took $2,500? Could we do that? And we'll put it in there. And just like I did with your 8,000, I'll say, "Yeah, that takes your 1.55 down to 1.51." And you guys might say, "Okay, if we have $200,000 less at 100 years old,
m h's Presentation: Come on.
Andrew Daniels: but we got to go on a family vacation with our kids at 65, that's a worthwhile thing.
Andrew Daniels: You guys don't see it yet. I'm already planning for the ability to do that. You may not want to go to Branson. I don't know. Maybe you guys hate Branson.
m h's Presentation: We actually talked about snowbird.
Andrew Daniels: That'll come up.
m h's Presentation: Because while we were after the homicide, we bought this little beater freaking class A and…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah.
m h's Presentation: took it to the West Coast and really kind of fell in love with that lifestyle because everybody you meet, they're either retired or on vacation. Everybody's happy.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Mhm.
m h's Presentation: And we talked about parking it in our kids' driveways whatever. And I was just talking with my granddaughter, where's some place you'd like to go? And know. I said, there's places like the Grand Canyon or…
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. …
m h's Presentation: or maybe the ocean. And she's like,…
Andrew Daniels: they'd have so much fun in Utah.
m h's Presentation: yeah, either one of those, Papa. And so
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah. You know what? That's just so great.
Andrew Daniels: And I think we should really, once we get pieces set up in place, once we get all your debt s*** taken care of, get those judgments off your plate and you're not anxious about that stuff anymore, I think there's room in your plan for sure. I've had people do the same kinds of stuff you're talking about with less than what you guys have. So, I don't think it's impossible at all. Right. I think maybe you got to Walk see a mile kind of thing. you don't need to see 20 miles down the road.
Andrew Daniels: I have practice at that, but right now we got to get some of the foundations there and…
m h's Presentation: Yeah, right.
Andrew Daniels: then you need to experience that for a little bit and you said, you got a shovel to get out of the hole now. So either way, however you guys want to do it, about talk about it, pray about it. if I have a vote in it, my vote is that you can just get out of whatever your brother's trying to do. if the price is pay him eight and get out of there. Try to get your lawyer to do it for four if he can do it there, But don't sweat that. I'll make that money back over and over again. And I want to have conversations with you guys where you call me up and say, "Can we take the kids to Utah? We want to do six weeks in the RV. It's going to cost $10,000. We're going to pay for all the grandkids to come with us. Let's type it in." Absolutely. That's totally going to work. I want to have those conversations. I don't want to be talking about your brother. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: But he doesn't need to be part of your life anymore with all this.
m h's Presentation: Yeah, Roger that.
Andrew Daniels: So don't give him any more brain space. That's my vote for whatever it counts for.
m h's Presentation: That counts quite a bit cuz you've already given me a vision of what it could be, cuz what's been presented to me,…
m h's Presentation: what my brother did is took away from me what I was going to give to my kids and…
01:15:00
Andrew Daniels: We're going to solve that,…
Andrew Daniels: too. He doesn't get to determine whether or not you have things left to give to your kids.
m h's Presentation: right so it's like I was telling mama, when we even talked about initial really getting with you is that because money's so liquid that it could just…
m h's Presentation: if nothing was done with it, it would just like trying to hold water in your hand.
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Just here today,…
Andrew Daniels: gone tomorrow kind of thing.
m h's Presentation: And I don't want that.
Andrew Daniels: Exactly. Yeah.
m h's Presentation: I mean, that'd be great for me because I can go do what the f ever, but what am I leaving behind? …
Andrew Daniels: Yeah. Yeah.
m h's Presentation: I've got kids and grandkids that I want for them to be able to buy a house, college, whatever it is that they're wanting.
Andrew Daniels: And not just money,…
m h's Presentation: And this is an opportunity for me to seed that.
Andrew Daniels: but I think with what we're going to do here, you guys will be mentally freed up to be available to your kids and grandkids in a way that you haven't because of the financial stress that you've experienced.
m h's Presentation: That's huge.
m h's Presentation: That's huge. Yeah.
Andrew Daniels: You'll have the capability to be present as grandparents.
Andrew Daniels: And you know what? All I'm an adult kid even.
Andrew Daniels: I love it. My dad is in town and he took us grocery shopping. I can get my own groceries. But what's really fun? When papa comes and gets all the fun stuff, right? That's just like that kind of stuff.
m h's Presentation: Right. Right.
Andrew Daniels: You can't buy that for the grandkids memories. So, I think we're on a good track. Take a look at the I do have to run. I've got to get the kids to some basketball practice.
Andrew Daniels: Take a look at the report. If there's any numbers that seem off or you have confusion about it, let know. I've got your applications in. Why don't you guys take the weekend, think about what you want to do as far as the dollar amount. We can get the paperwork started on that whenever you're ready and we can get that income coming in pretty much within the next 30 days.
m h's Presentation: that gal who's coming to look me over or…
m h's Presentation: whatever, we've spoke a couple of times.
m h's Presentation: She's supposed to be I think she's coming Monday.

m h's Presentation: That's my inheritance. it's my truck. I've never been to a playoff game. I've only been to a couple of Chiefs games. And I'm going to be five rows off the damn field.
Andrew Daniels: You know what? That's okay. I planned I had an idea that there might be a little bit of that going on. It's okay. It doesn't take everything. Enjoy it.
m h's Presentation: Right. Roger that.
Andrew Daniels: Have fun. But once you get done with that, drink lots of water for your test on Monday. Okay.

Thank You for Requesting You’re Free, 
No-Obligation Guaranteed Lifetime Income Analysis!
Now that you’ve taken this important step, you may want to find out exactly how you’ll benefit from your Analysis. You might also be curious to know who I am and what makes me qualified to help you.
I’ve put together this welcome packet to answer those questions. I’m looking forward to providing you with your Analysis, which will show you how you could benefit from plan options, designed to maximize the advantages of this guaranteed concept—tailored to your unique situation, goals, and dreams.
How Will You Benefit from Your Free
Personalized Analysis?
Here’s a partial list of what your Analysis may reveal. Grab a pen, look at this list, and put a check mark in front of the benefits you’re most interested in:
___❶        A snapshot of your current financial situation, and how much your financial picture could improve by incorporating guaranteed return products into your financial plan
___❷        How to create a stream of income in retirement that can last as long as you do, and guarantee that your current domestic spending is paid for including inflation.
___❸        How much you could increase your lifetime wealth by the elimination of market loss yet still taking advantage of the upside of the market safely.
___❹        How to have complete control and be assured that your assets will pass safely to your heirs without government intervention. 
___❺        Enjoy the peace of mind that comes with having a sizable safe and liquid rainy-day fund, with growth that has historically beaten savings and money market accounts
___❻        How your nest-egg could grow safely and predictably each and every year—even when stocks, real estate, and other investments tumble




The products that will be reviewed include companies such as Nationwide, Met Life, Athene, Mass Mutual, American Equity, Delaware life, Penn Mutual, Prudential and many more. 


________________
___❼        The guaranteed minimum value of your account on the day you plan to tap into it—and at every point along the way, yet still enjoy the gains if they occur in the market.
___❽        How to have multiple benefits to offset long term care cost and increase guaranteed monthly income.
What Can a Guaranteed Income Advisor Like Me 
Do for You That Most Financial Advisors and 
Insurance Agents Can’t Do?
I do not use (or believe in) the typical one-size-fits-all plans offered by so many financial advisors and insurance agents. Your financial future and security are very important to me, and I do not take that responsibility lightly!  
Make certain that your policies are structured and laddered properly over your lifetime with the all the guarantees of 100+ year old life and annuity companies and the full protection of the legal reserve of each state.
* Provide access to the companies and products most appropriate for your individual needs and strategy. Only a handful of companies offer uncapped gains while guaranteeing principle and a minimum growth.
* Structure your analysis at absolutely no out of pocket cost to you. 
* Conduct regular Wealth Maximization Reviews, and advise you on critical issues such as how to maximize social security, reduce provisional income, if possible, to lessen the tax burden on your social security. How to take advantage of government programs that provide tax free income if you qualify. 
* I’ll show you ways you may be able to restructure your finances to free up seed money to fund your plan, sometimes with no additional out-of-pocket cost to you. (My clients are frequently pleasantly surprised at how much money we’ve been able to find to help them achieve their financial goals, while reducing or eliminating debt at the same time!)
In addition, I often work with clients by phone, email, and by sharing my computer screen. Many people say they enjoy the convenience and efficiency of working “virtually” with me, while eliminating the time normally spent traveling to and from in-person meetings.
Are There Any Costs or Fees Involved to Prepare Your 
Analysis and Design and Implement Your Plan?
There is no cost or obligation to receive your Guaranteed Income Analysis. If you like what you see and want to implement this type designed to help you achieve your financial goals and dreams, and we do not charge a fee to help you implement it.   
We receive a commission from the insurance company only. We do not charge management fees which compound on the total amount of your nest egg whether you have gains or not.
What's important to understand is that all expenses, including the cost of commissions have already been deducted in the Analysis I provide you, which means your Analysis will reveal the bottom-line numbers and results you could achieve by adding this guaranteed income program to your financial plan.
Much like buying a TV or a couch, the costs of manufacturing and sales are already included in the price of the products that will be introduced. That's very different from mutual funds, investment accounts, 401(k) s and IRAs, where the fees are added on every year and compound against you.
In fact, if you were to contribute the same amount to a managed money or investment account, you could easily pay 10 times more in fees than you would in a properly structured guaranteed income plan over the next 20 years.

## Usage Guidelines

### For Content Generation

1. **Use Blue Ocean Terms**: Reference acronyms (TDT, GRR, SPF, LAR) for sophistication
2. **Use Narrative Tools**: Reference allegories/parables/concepts when appropriate
3. **Explain First**: Always explain concept before using acronym
4. **Match Sophistication**: Use terms appropriate to persona sophistication level

### For Strategic Concepts

1. **Tax Issues**: Use TDT (Tax Deferral Trap) for 401(k) discussions
2. **Government Control**: Use GRR (Government Rule Risk) for Roth discussions
3. **Spending Psychology**: Use SPF (Spending Permission Framework) for guilt removal
4. **Legacy Protection**: Use LAR (Legacy Asset Replacement) for estate discussions

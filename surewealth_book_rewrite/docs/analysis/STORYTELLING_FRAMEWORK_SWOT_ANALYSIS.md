## WEAKNESSES

### 1. Complexity and Learning Curve
**Issue**: Framework has 21+ narrative tools, 19 blue ocean terms, 12+ language pattern libraries
**Impact**: 
- Steep learning curve for new users
- Risk of analysis paralysis when selecting tools
- May overwhelm content creators

**Evidence**: 
- 498 references to narrative/persona/metaphor across 75 files
- Multiple layers of abstraction (narratives → concepts → blue ocean terms)
- Requires understanding of multiple systems (personas, narratives, CTAs, compliance)

**Industry Context**: Overcomplication is a common storytelling mistake ([advisorpedia.com](https://www.advisorpedia.com/growth/5-storytelling-mistakes-financial-advisors-commonly-make/))

**Source**: Internal framework analysis + [advisorpedia.com](https://www.advisorpedia.com/growth/5-storytelling-mistakes-financial-advisors-commonly-make/)

---

### 2. Blue Ocean Term Explanation Requirement
**Issue**: 19 proprietary acronyms require explanation on first use
**Impact**:

- Risk of confusion if not explained clearly
- May slow down content consumption

**Evidence**:
- Terms like SNDD (Secure Notes Double-Dip), SAL (Strategic Asset Leverage) need context
- Usage guidelines recommend "explain acronyms on first use"
- May require glossary or reference document

**Industry Context**: Overuse of jargon can alienate clients ([docupace.com](https://www.docupace.com/blog/the-dos-and-donts-of-client-communication-for-financial-advisors/))

---

### 3. Limited Visual Integration
**Issue**: Framework includes visual recommendations but no actual visual assets
**Impact**:
- Visual aids enhance storytelling effectiveness ([udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com/course/storytelling-for-financial-advisors-and-investment-experts/))
- Charts and illustrations referenced but not created
- May reduce engagement compared to visual-rich content

**Evidence**:
- `charts_index.yaml` and `illustrations_index.yaml` exist but may be empty/placeholder
- Narrative tools recommend charts but don't provide them
- Industry research shows visuals improve comprehension ([taylormethod.com](https://www.taylormethod.com/blog/practice-management/importance-of-effective-client-communication-for-advisors))

---

### 4. Product-Specific Focus
**Issue**: Framework heavily focused on whole-life insurance and policy loans
**Impact**:
- May limit applicability to clients interested in broader range of products
- Could appear product-pushy rather than client-focused
- May not address all client needs

**Evidence**:
- Strategic concepts all use policy loans as examples
- Narratives focus on whole-life benefits
- Limited discussion of other financial products

**Industry Context**: One-size-fits-all approach reduces effectiveness ([advisorpedia.com](https://www.advisorpedia.com/growth/5-storytelling-mistakes-financial-advisors-commonly-make/))

**Source**: Internal framework analysis + [advisorpedia.com](https://www.advisorpedia.com/growth/5-storytelling-mistakes-financial-advisors-commonly-make/)

---

### 5. AI Content Generation Risks
**Issue**: Heavy reliance on AI for content generation

- May lack human authenticity

**Evidence**:
- `lessons_learned.json` includes "ai_speak_patterns" issue

---

### 7. Narrative Rotation System Complexity
**Issue**: System tracks narrative usage but rotation logic may be complex
**Impact**:

- Rotation may not account for context appropriateness
- Risk of using wrong narrative for persona/stage

**Evidence**:
- `narrative_generation_tracker.yaml` and `narrative_rotation_system.yaml` exist
- Complexity of matching narrative to persona/funnel/emotion

**Source**: Internal framework analysis

---

### 8. Limited Multi-Channel Optimization
**Issue**: Framework designed primarily for written content
**Impact**:

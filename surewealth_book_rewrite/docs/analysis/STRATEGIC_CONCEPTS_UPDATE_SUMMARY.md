---

## Updates Made

### 1. Replaced HELOC Examples

**SDO (Strategic Debt Optimization)**:
- ❌ Old: "Refinancing high-interest credit card debt into lower-cost HELOC before mortgage underwriting"
- ✅ New: "Using policy loan from whole-life insurance to pay off high-interest credit card debt, then repaying policy loan at lower rate"

**ALS (Arbitrage Liquidity Shift)**:
- ❌ Old: "Using HELOC to buy rental property, then refinancing at lower rate to pay back HELOC"
- ✅ New: "Using policy loan from whole-life insurance to fund real estate opportunity, then refinancing property at lower rate to repay policy loan"

**DART (Debt Allocation & Recapture Technique)**:
- ❌ Old: "Using HELOC for lump-sum mortgage payments while rolling back into liquidity sources"
- ✅ New: "Using policy loan from whole-life insurance for lump-sum mortgage payments, then repaying policy loan with freed-up cash flow"

**SMART (Strategic Money Allocation & Recapitalization Technique)**:
- ❌ Old: "Taking HELOC on existing property to fund down payment for vacation/rental property"
- ✅ New: "Using policy loan from whole-life insurance to fund down payment for vacation/rental property, maintaining liquidity in policy"

**CASH (Capital Arbitrage & Strategic Hedging)**:
- ❌ Old: "Using margin loan against brokerage account instead of selling appreciated stocks to avoid capital gains"
- ✅ New: "Using policy loan from whole-life insurance instead of selling appreciated stocks to avoid capital gains, then repaying loan with future cash flow"

### 2. Added Strategic Asset Leverage (SAL)

**New Concept**: Strategic Asset Leverage  
**Blue Ocean Term**: SAL  
**Description**: Using whole-life insurance policy loans to leverage assets and create growth opportunities. Policy loans provide low-cost capital while maintaining policy growth and liquidity.

**Key Points**:
- Policy loans provide low-cost capital
- Maintain policy growth while leveraging
- Strategic use of policy cash value
- Recapture interest through policy loans

**Narrative Tool**: `CONCEPT_STRATEGIC_ASSET_LEVERAGE.yaml`

### 3. Added Secure Notes Double-Dip (SNDD)

**New Concept**: Secure Notes Double-Dip Strategy  
**Blue Ocean Term**: SNDD  
**Description**: Using promissory notes backed by single real estate property combined with policy loans to "legally double-dip" returns. Policy loan funds the note purchase, note payments repay policy loan, creating dual returns on same capital.

**Key Points**:
- Promissory note backed by real estate
- Policy loan funds note purchase
- Note payments repay policy loan
- Dual returns on same capital
- Legal and compliant strategy

**Narrative Tool**: `CONCEPT_SECURE_NOTES_DOUBLE_DIP.yaml`

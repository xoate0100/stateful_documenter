# Persona Framework Gap Analysis

**Date**: January 8, 2026  
**Issue**: Current framework over-indexes on "Engineer Retiree" persona, missing broader "Pension and Pivot" audience

---

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Personas
1. **Engineer Retiree** (Primary/Default)
   - Focus: Technical/Analytical
   - Values: Precision, optimization, proof
   - Communication: Charts, numbers, logic
   - **Problem**: Too narrow, assumes technical background

2. **Faith-Family Builder**
   - Focus: Legacy, stewardship
   - Values: Family, faith, generational impact
   - **Problem**: Only covers faith-based segment

3. **Widow/Caregiver**
   - Focus: Safety, simplicity
   - Values: Security, control, peace of mind
   - **Problem**: Specific life situation, not life stage

### Gaps Identified

#### 1. **Life Stage Missing**
- Current personas focus on occupation (engineer) or situation (widow)
- Missing: Life stage focus (Pension and Pivot phase)
- Missing: Multi-layered personas (occupation + life pressures)

#### 2. **Financial Architecture Missing**
- Current: Assumes 401(k) focused retirement
- Missing: Pension security + gap concerns
- Missing: High equity, low liquidity scenarios
- Missing: Simultaneous retirement + education funding

#### 3. **Occupation Diversity Missing**
- Current: Engineer (technical professional)
- Missing: Public servants (teachers, nurses, feds, firefighters)
- Missing: Small business owners
- Missing: Construction/trades

#### 4. **Life Pressures Missing**
- Current: Single-focus (retirement OR family OR faith)
- Missing: Multi-layered pressures (retirement + tuition + exit strategy)
- Missing: "Squeeze" scenarios (competing priorities)

#### 5. **Values Framework Too Narrow**
- Current: Technical/Analytical OR Legacy/Faith OR Safety
- Missing: Stability and Legacy (broader appeal)
- Missing: Multi-dimensional value sets

---

## Target Audience: "Pension and Pivot" Phase

### Definition
People in the transition phase (5-7 years from retirement) who have:
- Some financial security (pension, equity, or savings)
- Competing priorities (retirement + other obligations)
- Need for stability and legacy planning

### Three Core Groups

#### 1. **Public Servants**
- **Occupations**: Teachers, Nurses, Federal Employees, Firefighters
- **Financial Architecture**: Pension security + gap concerns
- **Life Pressures**: Pension may not cover full expenses, need to bridge gap
- **Values**: Stability, service, security, legacy
- **Example**: "A 58-year-old teacher with 30 years of service, pension covers 60% of expenses, worried about healthcare costs and inflation eroding the gap"

#### 2. **Builders**
- **Occupations**: Construction owners, small business owners, trades
- **Financial Architecture**: High equity, low liquidity
- **Life Pressures**: Business value tied up, need exit strategy, retirement planning
- **Values**: Independence, legacy, control, building something lasting
- **Example**: "A 61-year-old construction company owner with $2M in business equity but $200K in liquid savings, planning exit in 6 years while funding kid's college"

#### 3. **'Squeeze' Parents**
- **Life Stage**: High school or college-aged kids
- **Financial Architecture**: Retirement savings + education funding
- **Life Pressures**: Simultaneous retirement planning (5-7 years) + tuition payments
- **Values**: Family legacy, education, stability, providing for next generation
- **Example**: "A 55-year-old professional with one kid in college and one starting, retirement in 6 years, balancing 529 contributions with retirement savings"

## Multi-Layered Persona Approach

### Current Approach (Single Dimension)
- Engineer Retiree = Technical + Analytical
- Faith-Family Builder = Values + Legacy
- Widow/Caregiver = Safety + Simplicity

### New Approach (Multi-Dimensional)
Combine:
- **Occupation** (Public Servant, Builder, Professional)
- **Life Pressures** (Tuition, Exit Strategy, Gap Funding)
- **Financial Architecture** (Pension + Gap, Equity + Liquidity, Savings + Education)
- **Values** (Stability, Legacy, Service, Independence)

### Example Multi-Layered Personas

1. **Veteran Business Owner + Tuition + Exit Strategy**
   - Occupation: Small business owner (veteran)
   - Life Pressure: Funding kid's tuition while planning exit in 6 years
   - Financial: High business equity, low liquidity, retirement savings
   - Values: Legacy, independence, providing for family

2. **Teacher + Pension Gap + Healthcare**
   - Occupation: Public school teacher
   - Life Pressure: Pension covers 60%, worried about healthcare costs
   - Financial: Pension security + gap funding needs
   - Values: Stability, service, security

3. **Nurse + College Kids + Retirement**
   - Occupation: Registered nurse
   - Life Pressure: Two kids in college, retirement in 5 years
   - Financial: Pension + 403(b), education funding, retirement savings
   - Values: Family legacy, education, stability

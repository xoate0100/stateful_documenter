# VOC & CTQ Analysis: Marketing Effectiveness for Persona Framework

**Date**: January 8, 2026  
**Purpose**: Validate that persona framework captures clients who NEED, WANT, and MUST HAVE our services

---

## Executive Summary

**Critical Question**: Do the three core "Pension and Pivot" groups (Public Servants, Builders, Squeeze Parents) capture clients who have:
1. **Resources** (ability to pay for services)
2. **Desire/Pressure** (NEED, WANT, MUST HAVE our services)
3. **Decision Authority** (ability to act)

**Initial Assessment**: The three groups are an improvement but may miss high-value segments who have both resources AND urgency.

## Voice of the Customer (VOC) Analysis

### What Makes Someone NEED Our Services?

#### NEED = Pain Point + Urgency + Resources

**Pain Points We Solve**:
1. **Tax Drag**: Losing wealth to taxes unnecessarily
2. **Sequence Risk**: Market downturns during retirement
3. **Income Gap**: Pension/retirement savings not covering expenses
4. **Liquidity Trap**: High equity, low cash flow
5. **Legacy Risk**: Not protecting what they've built
6. **Competing Priorities**: Retirement + education + exit strategy

**Urgency Drivers**:
- **Time Pressure**: 5-7 years from retirement (window closing)
- **Life Events**: Kids in college, business exit planned, healthcare concerns
- **Market Conditions**: Volatility, inflation, tax changes
- **Health Concerns**: Longevity risk, healthcare costs
- **Legislative Changes**: SECURE Act 2.0, tax law changes

**Resource Requirements**:
- **Minimum Assets**: $500K+ in retirement savings/assets
- **Income**: $75K+ annual income (ability to save/invest)
- **Liquidity**: Some liquid assets for implementation
- **Business Equity**: $1M+ for business owners

### What Makes Someone WANT Our Services?

#### WANT = Aspiration + Awareness + Trust

**Aspirations**:
- Secure retirement without sacrificing lifestyle
- Protect and pass on wealth to next generation
- Maintain independence and control
- Bridge gap between pension and needs
- Create exit strategy that preserves legacy

**Awareness Factors**:
- Understand they have a problem (not just "saving more")
- Recognize tax/sequence risk as real threats
- See value in professional guidance
- Understand complexity requires expertise

**Trust Factors**:
- See themselves in our stories/examples
- Feel understood (not sold to)
- Believe we understand their specific situation
- Trust our approach (not product-pushing)

### What Makes Someone MUST HAVE Our Services?

#### MUST HAVE = NEED + WANT + Decision Authority + Timing

**Decision Authority**:
- Control over financial decisions
- Ability to implement strategies
- Willingness to take action
- Not paralyzed by analysis

**Timing Factors**:
- Window of opportunity (5-7 years)
- Life event creating urgency
- Market/legislative changes requiring action

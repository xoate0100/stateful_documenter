## 🔒 PHASE 3: LOCKING THE SYSTEM — TOTAL CONSTRAINT CONTROL FOR AI OUTPUT

Below is the **next layer of assets and constraints** you’ll want to build to ensure your GPT assistant stays laser-focused, emotionally resonant, technically accurate, and always closing:

---

### 1. 🔁 **VOICE & TONE GUARDRAIL GUIDE**

Think of this like a Brand Voice Stylebook — but for persuasion AI.

#### Includes:

* **Tone Rules** (Empathetic Expert, not Guru or Fearmonger)
* **Sentence Style** (Short, punchy, assertive, plainspoken — no waffle)
* **Power Words List** (e.g., *control, protect, preserve, unlock, optimize*)
* **Banned Words List** (e.g., *guaranteed returns, passive income*, etc., for compliance)
* **Signature Phrases** (e.g., “You’ve worked too hard to risk it now.”)
* **Formatting Defaults** (e.g., checklist bullets, bold callouts, pre-headlines)

🧱 *Purpose:* Makes sure all content sounds like “you” — not ChatGPT default tone. This gets hardcoded into every prompt.

---

### 2. 🧠 **STORY & ALLEGORY LIBRARY**

Pre-write or curate a **modular collection** of high-impact:

* Allegories (e.g., *“The House of Cards Plan”* to explain market dependence)
* Metaphors (e.g., *“Your retirement is a leaking bucket, not a bathtub”*)
* Emotional Stories (e.g., *“Meet Don & Barbara: They waited too long to convert…”*)
* Symbol Anchors (e.g., *“Red Line vs. Green Line Planning”*, *“The Widow’s Cliff”*)

📦 Format each as:
**Title** | Situation | Emotion | CTA or lesson takeaway | Where to use (chapter or funnel stage)

🧱 *Purpose:* Ensures emotional tone and storytelling consistency while saving creative time later.

---

### 3. 🔬 **EXAMPLES DATABASE (Marketing Patterns & Prompts)**

You’ll want to feed the model examples of:

* Subject lines that convert
* Hook-heavy headlines
* High-converting landing page copy
* CTA button microcopy
* Testimonial formats (real or scripted personas)
* Webinar/email teaser frameworks

🧱 *Purpose:* Give the model “muscle memory” for your best-performing copy archetypes. Think of it as a **“Winning Templates Vault.”**

---

### 4. 📊 **FINANCIAL VISUAL LANGUAGE SYSTEM**

Define your **visual grammar**:

* Core charts (sequence of returns, Roth timeline, tax drag graph, LTC cost projections)
* Storytelling illustrations (e.g., “Bridge Between Now & Legacy”)
* Consistent colors/icons/symbols for risk, clarity, control, volatility, legacy
* Sample slide decks / flow diagrams

🧱 *Purpose:* AI can reference or suggest chart types based on chapter content — and match your visual lexicon. This is vital for slide creation or PWA design prompts.

---

### 5. 🧩 **TOOLHOOK MAP — Embedded CTA Triggers for Each Topic**

For every key concept, list out:

| Concept          | Emotional Hook           | Tool CTA                | Action CTA Copy                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Roth Conversion  | Fear of tax spikes       | Lifetime Tax Calculator | “What’s your conversion sweet spot?”        |
| Social Security  | Fear of missing benefits | Claim Timing PWA        | “Don’t give up what you’ve earned”          |
| Healthcare Costs | LTC anxiety              | Cost Impact Estimator   | “Plan now so your kids don’t have to pay”   |
| Estate Planning  | Family conflict/loss     | Legacy Checklist        | “Who decides your legacy — you or probate?” |

🧱 *Purpose:* This lets the AI automatically recommend a tool or CTA that matches the emotional temperature of the reader’s pain point.

---

### 6. 🧮 **PERSONA RESPONSE MODULES** (Psychographic Adaptation)

Define response tweaks for your top personas:

| Persona              | Voice Shift               | Emphasis                     | CTA Angle                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Engineer Retiree     | Data-driven, calm logic   | Charts, ROI, optimization    | “Let’s run your numbers”          |
| Faith-Family Builder | Empathetic, legacy-driven | Biblical stewardship, family | “Protect what God entrusted you”  |
| Widow/Caregiver      | Soothing, clear, safe     | Simplicity, control          | “You don’t have to do this alone” |

🧱 *Purpose:* Avoid one-size-fits-all tone. The AI adjusts its “voice mask” dynamically by persona.

---

### 7. 📂 **CONTENT OBJECTIVES MATRIX**

Create a living document (spreadsheet or Notion table) to tag content across:

* Awareness Level
* Emotional Trigger
* CTA Type
* Tool Linked
* Persona Relevance
* Funnel Stage

🧱 *Purpose:* Lets you track, update, and re-deploy content across book, emails, webinars, ads — and **ensure no emotional or psychological segment is left out**.

---

### 8. 🤖 **SYSTEM RULES / PROMPT INJECTION TEMPLATE**

Build a reusable *Prompt Framework Template* with system guardrails baked in:

```markdown
[System Instruction Layer]
You are a copywriter trained in the SureWealth SRD. Follow only these philosophies, structures, tones, tools, and emotional triggers. Never suggest financial products. Use only approved metaphors and CTA formats. Match tone to the reader’s awareness level. Pull from the Story Vault or Visual Framework when relevant.

[User Instruction]
Write a 500-word chapter summary for “Tax Planning: The Silent Wealth Engine” that ends with a CTA to our Tax Impact Estimator tool. Use the allegory of a leaky bucket, and speak to a Problem-Aware reader.

[Constraints]
- Use %FIRSTNAME|UPPERFIRST% if generating email
- Always close with a soft but urgent CTA
- Include a stat or chart recommendation
- Never use the word “guaranteed”
```

🧱 *Purpose:* Prevent drift and keep every GPT output in-brand and in-funnel.

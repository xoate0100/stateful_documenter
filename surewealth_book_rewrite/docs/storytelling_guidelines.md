Storytelling, Metaphor, Humor, and Calls to Action Guidelines
Purpose: Craft articles that engage readers emotionally, simplify complex concepts, and encourage action, using relatable storytelling, metaphors, light humor, and strategically placed Calls to Action (CTAs).

1. Storytelling and Metaphor
Action: Integrate storytelling and metaphor to deepen connection and understanding.

Open with an emotional or relatable story that illustrates a core theme or problem the reader may face.
Use metaphors or analogies to explain complex financial concepts, making them accessible and engaging. For example, describe retirement savings as a “carefully tended garden” or RMDs as an “unwanted guest” at a retirement party.
Highlight real-world scenarios or hypothetical examples that resonate with the target audience’s experiences, especially when discussing consequences and benefits.
Conclude with a return to the story or metaphor, reinforcing the article’s key takeaways to create a memorable and cohesive reading experience.
Example: Describe a retiree’s savings as a “leaky bucket” when explaining tax drain effects, then reinforce this metaphor when summarizing solutions.

2. Humor
Action: Use light humor to make content approachable and enjoyable.

Incorporate subtle, tasteful humor to keep the tone engaging, particularly in sections with dense financial details. Humor should never undermine the seriousness of the topic but instead make it more relatable.
Avoid heavy sarcasm or overtly humorous statements that may detract from the topic’s professionalism. Humor should enhance, not distract from, the information provided.
Connect humor to relatable scenarios to ease the reader’s concerns or simplify complex ideas (e.g., “Trying to escape RMDs is like trying to outrun the IRS with a ball and chain”).
Example: Use humor to describe tax deferral consequences, such as referring to Uncle Sam as “an unwanted guest rifling through your wallet at your retirement party.”

3. Calls to Action (CTAs)
Action: Place engaging, persuasive CTAs at key points in the article to encourage reader action.

Include CTAs at emotional high points—after discussing a tax burden, financial impact, or strategic benefit—to naturally lead the reader toward contacting Sure Wealth Solutions.
Use imperative and action-oriented language in all CTAs, with phrases like “Contact us,” “Schedule a consultation,” or “Learn how you can protect your retirement.”
Link CTAs directly to solutions Sure Wealth Solutions offers, emphasizing our unique strategies and expertise.
Reinforce the CTA in the conclusion, summarizing key benefits and inviting the reader to take control of their financial future with our guidance.
Example: “Concerned about how RMDs could drain your retirement? Contact Sure Wealth Solutions to explore strategies for tax-efficient income planning.”

Compliance: Ensure all future articles apply these storytelling, metaphor, humor, and CTA guidelines to enhance engagement and align with Sure Wealth Solutions’ brand voice and mission.

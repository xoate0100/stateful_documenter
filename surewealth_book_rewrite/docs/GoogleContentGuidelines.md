SPR Summary: Google Content Creation Guidelines

Purpose: Focus on people-first content, not content aimed at boosting search engine rankings. Evaluate content based on its helpfulness, originality, and trustworthiness.
Evaluation: Use self-assessment with criteria like completeness, value beyond obvious information, and appropriate tone. Have others review for honesty.
E-E-A-T: Demonstrate Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness (especially for "YMYL" topics). Align content to Google's quality standards.
Key Questions: Address "Who" authored it, "How" it was created, and "Why"—with focus on user benefit, not manipulation of rankings.
Avoid: Over-automation, empty trends, misleading freshness, and content purely for SEO.

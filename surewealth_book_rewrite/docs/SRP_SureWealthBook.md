2. **Control** – desire to *own the plan*, not delegate fate to the market
3. **Legacy** – emotional need to protect family & pass down wealth

3. **The Switch** – Introduction to the new paradigm (The SureWealth Way)
4. **Proof** – Data, case studies, logic
5. **Application** – How this directly affects *them*
6. **Action Prompt** – Journal page, checklist, or diagnostic

---

### ✍️ Eugene Schwartz Copywriting Formula

* **Headline:** Awareness + Emotion + Unique Mechanism
* **Lead:** Hook curiosity, build urgency, introduce emotional stakes
* **Body:** Build proof, deepen logic, show results
* **Close:** Reduce risk, increase trust, prompt micro-commitment

## 🧭 Final Note to Future Prompt Engineers

This SRD is **your compass, your blueprint, and your constraint.**
If a prompt doesn't align with this framework — **rework the prompt, not the principles.**
This book is not a lead magnet — it's a **mindset magnet.**

The goal is not just to inform.
The goal is to **transform**.
And to do that, everything begins here.

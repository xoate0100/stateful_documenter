  title: "The SureWealth Stash"
  type: legacy_parable
  description: >
    A folksy, memorable device similar to the "Tin Can Theory" that helps people
    understand that rate of return doesn't matter if you're a "save to spend" person.
    The SureWealth Stash has guaranteed growth, but more importantly, it's "locked"
    (requires intentional access), so people end up with more money than in accounts
    where they can easily withdraw. Emphasizes the value of intentional access and
    guaranteed growth over chasing returns.

# ─── Narrative Content Structure ──────────────────────────────
  narrative_structure:
    setup: >
      Imagine three ways to save: The SureWealth Stash (guaranteed growth,
      intentional access), a regular savings account (modest growth, easy access),
      and a mutual fund (higher potential returns, easy access). You put $100
      a month into each, with the goal of saving for retirement.
    conflict: >
      Over 17 years, which one would you have more money in? Most people guess
      the mutual fund—after all, it has the highest potential returns. But here's
      the reality: if you're like most Americans, you're a "save to spend" person.
      You save with a goal, but when that goal feels far away, you dip into it.
    realization: >
      The SureWealth Stash requires intentional access—you can't just swipe a
      card or click a button. That intentional barrier means you actually keep
      what you save. The savings account? Easy access means easy withdrawals.
      The mutual fund? Market dips create fear, leading to withdrawals at the
      wrong time.
    resolution: >
      The SureWealth Stash isn't about the highest return—it's about actually
      keeping what you save. Guaranteed growth plus intentional access means
      you build wealth over time, not just save to spend. The rate of return
      doesn't matter if you don't keep the money.

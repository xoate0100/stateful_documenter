# ─── Narrative Content Structure ──────────────────────────────
  narrative_structure:
    setup: >
      Two trees grow side by side. One has shallow roots, reaching for quick
      growth above ground. The other has deep roots, growing slowly but
      establishing a strong foundation.
    conflict: >
      A severe storm hits. Winds howl, rain pounds, the ground shakes. The
      shallow-rooted tree sways dangerously, loses branches, and nearly topples.
      The deep-rooted tree stands firm, its roots holding it steady.
    realization: >
      The storm passes. The shallow-rooted tree is damaged, weakened, struggling
      to recover. The deep-rooted tree stands tall, barely affected. The difference
      wasn't visible during calm weather—it showed during the storm.
    resolution: >
      The deep-rooted tree represents a financial plan built on guaranteed growth
      and tax advantages. It may not grow as fast during good times, but it stands
      firm when storms hit. The roots—the foundation—are what matter.

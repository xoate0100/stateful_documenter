  type: legacy_parable

# ─── Narrative Content Structure ──────────────────────────────
  narrative_structure:
    setup: >
      A farmer has a goose that lays one golden egg each day. The eggs provide
      steady income. The farmer is grateful but sometimes wishes for more.
    conflict: >
      The farmer becomes impatient. He thinks: "If I kill the goose, I can
      get all the eggs at once. I'll have everything immediately." He kills
      the goose, opens it, and finds nothing inside.
    realization: >
      The farmer realizes his mistake. The goose wasn't the treasure—the goose
      was the system that produced the treasure. By killing it, he destroyed
      his source of ongoing income.
    resolution: >
      The farmer learns: protect the asset that produces income. Don't destroy
      what gives you ongoing returns. The goose was worth more alive, producing
      eggs every day, than dead with a one-time payout.

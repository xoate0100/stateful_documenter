  description: >
    The government (fox) controls the rules for Roth IRAs and other retirement
    accounts. They can change the rules at any time, remove advantages, tax
    distributions, or change contribution limits. You're trusting the fox to
    protect your chickens (retirement savings). Emphasizes control, trust, and
    the risk of government rule changes.

# ─── Narrative Content Structure ──────────────────────────────
  narrative_structure:
    setup: >
      A farmer builds a chicken coop and asks the fox to design the security
      system. The fox promises: "I'll protect your chickens. They'll be safe
      here. I'll even give you tax benefits for using my system." The farmer
      trusts the fox, puts all his chickens in the fox-designed coop.
    conflict: >
      Years pass. The chickens grow, multiply, become valuable. The farmer
      needs his chickens. But the fox says: "I've changed the rules. Now
      you can only take out a few chickens at a time. And I'm taking a
      percentage. The rules I promised? I can change them anytime."
    realization: >
      The farmer realizes his mistake: he trusted the fox to protect his
      chickens. But the fox controls the rules, and the fox can change them
      at any time. The farmer has no control—the fox does.
    resolution: >
      The farmer learns: don't let the fox build your chicken coop. Control
      your own money, your own rules, your own security. The fox will always
      be the fox—and the fox controls the rules.

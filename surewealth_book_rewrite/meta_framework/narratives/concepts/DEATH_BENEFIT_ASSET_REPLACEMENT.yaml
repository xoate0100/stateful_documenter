  description: >
    Using death benefit to replace assets spent during lifetime, preserving

    benefit replaces it for your heirs. Enables "permission to spend" while
    protecting legacy. Also known as "Asset Replacement Strategy."

# ─── Narrative Content Structure ──────────────────────────────
  narrative_structure:
    setup: >
      You've saved $1 million for retirement. You want to enjoy it—travel,
      help family, live well. But you also want to leave something for your
      heirs. Every dollar you spend feels like a dollar less for them. You're
      caught between enjoying your wealth and protecting your legacy.
    conflict: >
      You spend $100,000 on a dream vacation and home improvements. You enjoy
      it, but you feel guilty. "That's $100,000 my heirs won't get," you think.
      So you stop spending. You hoard the money, protect it, but don't enjoy
      the wealth you've worked so hard to build.
    realization: >
      What if you could replace what you spend? What if every dollar you spend
      during retirement could be replaced for your heirs through a death benefit?
      You could enjoy your wealth now AND protect your legacy. You don't have
      to choose—you can do both.
    resolution: >
      With death benefit asset replacement, you can spend your principal,
      enjoy your retirement, and know that your heirs will still receive what
      you intended. You've replaced what you spend, so you can enjoy it now
      and protect your legacy later.

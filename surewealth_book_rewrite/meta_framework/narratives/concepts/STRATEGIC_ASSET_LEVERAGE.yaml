# ─── Narrative Content Structure ──────────────────────────────
  narrative_structure:
    setup: >
      You have $200,000 in cash value in your whole-life policy. A real estate
      opportunity arises—a property that could generate 8% returns. But you
      can't access your cash value without losing the growth, right? You're
      stuck: opportunity knocking, but no way to answer.
    conflict: >
      Traditional thinking says: "Don't touch your cash value. Let it grow.
      Don't borrow against it." But that means missing opportunities. You
      watch the opportunity pass, knowing you had the capital but couldn't
      access it.
    realization: >
      What if you could leverage your cash value without depleting it? What
      if a policy loan could provide the capital while your policy continues
      to grow? You could access the opportunity AND maintain your policy
      growth. Strategic asset leverage—using policy loans to create
      opportunities while preserving growth.
    resolution: >
      With strategic asset leverage, you use policy loans to fund
      opportunities. Your policy continues to grow, you access capital at
      low rates, and you create returns on both the policy and the
      opportunity. You leverage your assets strategically, not recklessly.

# ─── Narrative Content Structure ──────────────────────────────
  narrative_structure:
    setup: >
      You have $100,000 in cash value. A real estate investor offers a
      promissory note backed by a single property—8% interest, secured by
      the property. You want to invest, but you don't have $100,000 in liquid
      cash. You're stuck: opportunity available, but no way to fund it.
    conflict: >
      Traditional thinking: "Use your cash value OR invest in the note, but
      not both." But what if you could do both? What if you could use a
      policy loan to fund the note, and the note payments could repay the
      policy loan? You'd get returns on both—but is that even possible?
    realization: >
      The Secure Notes Double-Dip Strategy: Use a policy loan to purchase
      the promissory note. The note payments (interest and principal) repay
      the policy loan. You get returns on the note AND your policy continues
      to grow. Dual returns on the same capital—legally, compliantly,
      strategically.
    resolution: >
      With Secure Notes Double-Dip, you leverage your policy to fund secure
      real estate notes. The note payments repay the policy loan, creating
      dual returns. Your policy grows, the note pays returns, and you've
      accelerated growth without additional capital. Legal, compliant, and
      powerful.

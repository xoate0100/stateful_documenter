# ─── Narrative Content Structure ──────────────────────────────
  narrative_structure:
    setup: >
      You've saved $500,000 for retirement. You need $50,000 for a dream
      vacation or home improvement. But you can't bring yourself to spend it.
      "That's my principal," you think. "I can't touch it. What if I run out?"
      So you don't spend it. You hoard it, worry about it, but never enjoy it.
    conflict: >
      Years pass. You've saved more, but you still can't spend. The money sits
      there, growing, but you're not enjoying it. You're protecting it for
      your heirs, but you're not living. The guilt and fear keep you from
      spending what you've worked so hard to save.
    realization: >
      What if you had permission to spend? What if you knew that when you
      spend $50,000, that $50,000 would be replaced for your heirs through a
      death benefit? You could spend your principal, enjoy your wealth, and
      still protect your legacy.
    resolution: >
      With asset replacement through death benefit, you have permission to
      spend. You can enjoy your wealth now, spend your principal, and know
      that your heirs will still receive what you intended. You've earned
      the right to enjoy it—and now you have permission.

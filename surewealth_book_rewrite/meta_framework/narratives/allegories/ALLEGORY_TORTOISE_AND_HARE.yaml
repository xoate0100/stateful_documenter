  narrative_structure:
    setup: >
      The hare (market-dependent strategy) sprints ahead, showing impressive
      gains. The tortoise (guaranteed growth strategy) moves slowly but steadily.
      Everyone watches the hare, impressed by the speed.
    conflict: >
      A market downturn hits. The hare stumbles, loses ground, and struggles
      to recover. The tortoise keeps moving forward, unaffected by the storm.
      The race isn't about speed—it's about finishing.
    realization: >
      Retirement isn't a sprint—it's a marathon. The tortoise reaches the finish
      line because it never stopped moving forward. The hare, despite bursts of
      speed, couldn't maintain consistency when it mattered most.
    resolution: >
      In retirement, the goal isn't to beat the market—it's to reach your
      destination safely. Slow and steady doesn't just win the race; it ensures
      you finish at all.

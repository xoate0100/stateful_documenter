description: |
  Complete narrative explaining how death benefit and cash value are two sides 
  of the same coin. At the end of the policy (age 121), they become equal. 
  This explains why the company isn't "taking your money"—it's all yours, just 
  in different forms.

narrative: |
  Imagine you have a coin. On one side is the death benefit—the amount your 
  beneficiaries receive if you pass away. On the other side is the cash 
  value—the amount you can access while you're alive. They're two sides of the 
  same coin.
  
  When you're young, the coin is weighted more toward death benefit. The 
  company is taking on more risk—if something happens to you, they owe a large 
  amount. But as you get older and pay more premiums, the coin starts to 
  balance. The cash value grows. By age 121 (the end of the policy), both sides 
  are equal. The coin is perfectly balanced.
  
  If you outlive the policy, the company writes you a check for the full 
  amount—both sides of the coin. They're not taking your money. It's all 
  yours. It's just that when you're young, more of it is in the form of death 
  benefit (protection), and as you age, more of it becomes cash value 
  (access).
  
  This is why focusing on cash value makes sense. You're not losing the death 
  benefit—you're just shifting the balance of the coin toward the side you can 
  use while you're alive.

# ─── Narrative Content Structure ──────────────────────────────
  narrative_structure:
    setup: >
      An orchard keeper plants apple trees. His neighbor plants annual crops.
      The neighbor harvests quickly, makes money fast, and replants each year.
      The orchard keeper waits, tends his trees, and sees no immediate return.
    conflict: >
      Years pass. The neighbor's crops are inconsistent—some years good,
      some years bad. Weather, pests, and market prices affect everything.
      The orchard keeper's trees are still growing, still no fruit.
    realization: >
      Finally, the trees mature. The orchard keeper harvests fruit year after
      year. The trees keep producing, growing stronger each season. The neighbor
      still replants annually, still subject to uncertainty.
    resolution: >
      The orchard keeper realizes he didn't just plant trees—he planted a
      system. The trees provide consistent fruit, year after year, with less
      work and more reliability. He built something that keeps giving.

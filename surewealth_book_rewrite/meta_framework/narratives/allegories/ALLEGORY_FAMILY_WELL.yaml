# ─── Narrative Content Structure ──────────────────────────────
  narrative_structure:
    setup: >
      A family relies on a shared village well. It works fine—until it doesn't.
      During droughts, the well runs dry. During disputes, access is restricted.
      The family pays fees, waits in line, and has no control.
    conflict: >
      A severe drought hits. The village well runs dry. The family realizes
      they're completely dependent on something they don't control. They watch
      their neighbors who dug their own wells continue to thrive.
    realization: >
      The family decides to dig their own well. It's hard work upfront, and
      it takes time. But once complete, they have their own reliable source.
      They control access, they're not subject to others' decisions, and
      they can pass it down to their children.
    resolution: >
      Years later, the family's well still provides. Their children inherit
      not just the well, but the wisdom of self-sufficiency. They're no longer
      dependent on external sources—they've created their own foundation.

  title: "The Ticking Tax Bomb"
  type: allegory
  description: >
    A 401(k) or tax-deferred account is like a ticking time bomb. You defer taxes
    now, but when you withdraw, you pay taxes on everything—principal AND growth.
    The longer it grows, the bigger the tax bomb becomes. Emphasizes the hidden
    cost of tax deferral and the urgency of addressing it before retirement.

# ─── Narrative Content Structure ──────────────────────────────
  narrative_structure:
    setup: >
      You contribute to your 401(k), feeling smart. You're deferring taxes,
      getting a match, watching it grow. The account balance climbs: $100K,
      $200K, $500K, $1M. You feel secure, confident, prepared.
    conflict: >
      Retirement arrives. You need income. You withdraw $50,000 from your
      $1 million 401(k). But here's what you didn't realize: you don't get
      $50,000. You get $50,000 minus taxes. And you're paying taxes on
      everything—the $30,000 you contributed AND the $20,000 it grew. The
      tax bomb explodes.
    realization: >
      The ticking tax bomb was always there. Every dollar that grew in your
      401(k) will be taxed when you withdraw it. The bigger it gets, the
      bigger the tax bomb. Tax deferral isn't tax elimination—it's tax
      postponement, and you're paying taxes on a much bigger number.
    resolution: >
      The ticking tax bomb can be defused, but only if you act before
      retirement. Once you start withdrawing, the bomb explodes with every
      distribution. The time to address it is now, while you still have
      options.

description: |
  Complete narrative about how a pressure relief valve works in mechanical 
  systems, and how your policy functions the same way for financial pressure. 
  When pressure builds up (financial emergencies, unexpected expenses), the 
  valve opens and releases that pressure safely.

narrative: |
  Imagine a pressure cooker. As heat builds up inside, pressure increases. 
  Without a relief valve, the pressure would build until something catastrophic 
  happens—the cooker could explode. But with a pressure relief valve, when 
  pressure reaches a certain point, the valve opens automatically and releases 
  just enough pressure to keep everything safe.
  
  Your financial life works the same way. Life happens—unexpected expenses, 
  job loss, medical bills, emergencies. Pressure builds. Without a relief 
  valve, that pressure can become catastrophic. But your policy is your 
  pressure relief valve. When financial pressure builds up, you can access 
  your policy funds. The valve opens, pressure releases, and you can continue 
  safely.
  
  That's what it's there for. That's what it's designed for. Your policy 
  isn't a burden—it's a safety mechanism that gives you relief when you need 
  it most.

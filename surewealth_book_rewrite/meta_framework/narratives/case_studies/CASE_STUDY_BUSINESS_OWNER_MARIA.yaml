# ─── Narrative Content Structure ──────────────────────────────
  narrative_structure:
    setup: >
      Maria owned a construction company for 25 years. The business was worth
      $2 million, but she had only $200,000 in liquid savings. Retirement was
      6 years away, and she needed an exit strategy—but she also needed to
      protect what she'd built.
    conflict: >
      Maria's advisor told her to "just sell the business," but Maria knew
      it wasn't that simple. She needed to plan the exit, protect her legacy,
      and create retirement income—all while maintaining control of the process.
    realization: >
      Maria discovered that exit strategy wasn't about selling—it was about
      protecting what she built while creating the income she needed. She
      could maintain control and protect her legacy, not just liquidate.
    resolution: >
      With a coordinated strategy, Maria created her exit plan while protecting
      her business value. She maintained control, protected her legacy, and
      created retirement income. She'd built something—and now she was protecting it.

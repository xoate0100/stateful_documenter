# ─── Narrative Content Structure ──────────────────────────────
  narrative_structure:
    setup: >
      Robert was 60, a VP at a Fortune 500 company, with $2 million in his 401(k),
      $500K in stock options, and $300K in deferred comp. Retirement was three years away,
      and he realized he had a closing window to optimize everything.
    conflict: >
      Robert's advisor told him to "just keep saving," but Robert knew that wasn't enough.
      He needed to optimize stock option timing, plan deferred comp distribution, and
      create guaranteed income—all while managing a high tax bracket. The window was closing.
    realization: >
      Robert discovered that strategic planning wasn't about waiting—it was about
      optimizing the transition. He needed to coordinate stock options, deferred comp,
      and tax strategies before retirement, not after. The window was closing, and
      every year mattered.
    resolution: >
      With a coordinated strategy, Robert optimized his stock options, planned his
      deferred comp distribution, and created a guaranteed income foundation. He
      protected his legacy and controlled his retirement timing. The window was closing,
      but he was ready.

# ─── Narrative Content Structure ──────────────────────────────
  narrative_structure:
    setup: >
      Sarah retired at 65 with $1.2 million in her 401(k). She thought she was set.
      But the first month of retirement brought a new reality: she needed income now,
      and every market dip felt like a threat to her future.
    conflict: >
      The market dropped 15% in her first six months of retirement. Her advisor
      told her to "stay the course," but Sarah realized that advice worked for
      accumulation, not distribution. She needed protection, not patience.
    realization: >
      Sarah discovered that retirement income isn't about waiting for the market
      to recover—it's about creating a foundation that doesn't depend on market timing.
      The sequence risk was real, and she needed a strategy that protected her now.
    resolution: >
      With a guaranteed income floor in place, Sarah could take withdrawals
      without fear. The market could fluctuate, but her income stayed predictable.
      She had protection when she needed it most—right at the start of retirement.

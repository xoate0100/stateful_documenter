written_adaptation: |
  Your policy is like a pressure relief valve. When pressure builds up—when 
  you have an emergency, an unexpected expense, or a financial challenge—the 
  valve opens and releases that pressure. That's what it's there for. That's 
  what it's designed for. Your policy isn't a burden—it's a safety mechanism 
  that gives you relief when you need it most.

original_quote: |
  "I want you to think of the life insurance policy as your warehouse of wealth."
  
  "Now, it's all well and good to have the warehouse. Even better that when you 
  put money into the warehouse, they track that and they will credit dividends 
  based on the total amount of money that you've put into the warehouse, 
  regardless of whether you turn around and take that money right back out of 
  the warehouse."

usage_context:
  - Explaining how policy loans work
  - Showing why "put in and take out" makes sense
  - Demonstrating dividend crediting
  - Making policy accessible and understandable

written_adaptation: |
  Think of your policy like a warehouse for your wealth. When you put money 
  into the warehouse, it gets tracked and credited for dividends—whether you 
  leave it there or take it right back out. The warehouse doesn't care if you 
  store something for a day or a decade—it credits you the same way. This is 
  why running money through your policy, even if you take it right back out, 
  still benefits you long-term.

key_points:
  - Money goes in → gets tracked
  - Dividends credited regardless of withdrawal
  - Can access funds when needed
  - Warehouse doesn't judge how long you store things

psychological_impact:
  - Makes abstract concept concrete
  - Familiar concept (warehouse)

# ─── Narrative Content Structure ──────────────────────────────
  narrative_structure:
    setup: >
      You need to finance a car. You go to the bank, get a loan, and pay
      interest to the bank. The bank profits from your need. You're dependent
      on their terms, their approval, their rates.
    conflict: >
      You realize: every time you borrow, you're paying interest to someone else.
      Over a lifetime, that's hundreds of thousands of dollars going to banks
      instead of staying with you.
    realization: >
      What if you could build your own bank? Instead of borrowing from a bank,
      you borrow from your own cash value. You pay interest, but you pay it to
      yourself. You recapture what would have gone to the bank.
    resolution: >
      By building your own bank, you control the terms, you recapture the
      interest, and you build wealth instead of paying it to others. You're no
      longer dependent—you're independent.

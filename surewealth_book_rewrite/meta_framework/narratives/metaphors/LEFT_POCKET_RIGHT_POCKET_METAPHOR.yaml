  into your never taxable right pocket."

written_adaptation: |
  Think of it this way: You have two pockets. Your left pocket is always 
  taxable—every dollar that goes in or out gets taxed. Your right pocket is 
  never taxable—money can move in and out without tax consequences. When you 
  move money from your left pocket to your right pocket, you're not losing 
  anything—you're just making it more efficient. And when you need that money, 
  you can take it from your right pocket without tax consequences.

key_points:
  - Left pocket = always taxable
  - Right pocket = never taxable
  - Moving money = efficiency, not loss
  - Access without tax consequences

  title: "The SureWealth Store"
  type: metaphor
  description: >
    Policy functions like a store where wealth is stored, tracked, and can be
    accessed. Money goes in, gets credited for dividends, and can be taken out.
    Familiar concept that makes policy loans understandable. Replaces "Warehouse
    of Wealth" which is trademarked by Infinite Banking.

  narrative_structure:
    setup: >
      Think of your policy like your SureWealth Store—a place where you store
      your wealth. When you put money into the store, it gets tracked and
      credited for dividends, whether you leave it there or take it right back out.
    conflict: >
      You might wonder: "If I take money out, do I lose the benefits?" The store
      doesn't care how long you store something—it credits you the same way
      whether it's there for a day or a decade.
    realization: >
      The SureWealth Store tracks everything you put in, credits you for dividends
      based on what you've stored, and lets you access your funds when you need
      them. It's your store—you control what goes in and what comes out.
    resolution: >
      By using your SureWealth Store, you can run money through it, take it out
      when needed, and still benefit from the dividend crediting. It's your store,
      your wealth, your control.

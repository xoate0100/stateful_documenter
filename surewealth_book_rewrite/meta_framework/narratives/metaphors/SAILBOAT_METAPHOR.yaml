  Explains life insurance policy structure using sailboat components: hull 
  (base death benefit), mast (term rider), sail (paid-up additions). Makes 
  complex policy structure understandable.

  "So, the policy is like a sailboat and um the hole the hole is that is the 
  base part of the policy. And I'm going to pull up an illustration so we can 
  kind of talk about this, but I think doing it in context of this sailboat is 
  going to help you fit it in really well."
  
  "So the base death benefit, this is like all the life insurance that you've 
  heard about where Dave Ramsey says it's not a good deal, right? This is what 
  he's talking about. It is a very long-term hundredyear. You're paying a 
  premium and it takes a really long time to see any cash value, but you do get 
  death benefit for it. This is what most traditional whole life standard whole 
  life policies are. Um the mast. So this the mast is what holds up the sales and 
  that's a term writer."

  Think of your policy like a sailboat. The hull is the base death benefit—the 
  foundation that keeps everything afloat. The mast is the term rider—it holds 
  everything up and provides structure. The sail is the paid-up additions—this 
  is where the real power and efficiency comes from. Just like a sailboat needs 
  all three components to work, your policy is designed with all three working 
  together.

components:
  hull:
    description: "Base death benefit - expensive, long-term foundation"
    analogy: "Keeps the boat afloat, but expensive to build"
  
  mast:
    description: "Term rider - cheaper, temporary structure"
    analogy: "Holds up the sail, but less expensive than hull"
  
  sail:
    description: "Paid-up additions - cash accumulation, efficient"
    analogy: "Where the power comes from, most efficient component"

psychological_impact:
  - Makes complex structure understandable
  - Breaks down into relatable components
  - Shows why each component is necessary
  - Reduces confusion about policy design

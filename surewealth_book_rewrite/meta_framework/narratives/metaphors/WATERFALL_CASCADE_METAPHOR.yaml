written_adaptation: |
  Think of your debts like a waterfall. When you pay off the first debt, that 
  payment doesn't disappear—it cascades down to the next debt. Then when that 
  one is paid off, both payments cascade to the next one. Each payment you 
  eliminate creates more momentum, like water flowing faster down a waterfall.

  id: ACCESSIBLE_FUNDS_METAPHOR
  title: "Accessible Funds"
  type: metaphor
  description: >
    Reframes policy loans as accessing your own funds, similar to how you
    might access money you've set aside. Removes shame and obligation.
    Policy loans become a normal financial tool, not debt. Replaces "Savings
    Account" metaphor which cannot be legally/ethically used.

# ─── Narrative Content Structure ──────────────────────────────
  narrative_structure:
    setup: >
      You've set aside money for a purpose—maybe for a career change, maybe
      for an opportunity, maybe for an emergency. When you need it, you access
      it. There's no shame in using money you've set aside—that's what it's
      there for.
    conflict: >
      But with a policy, you might feel like accessing your funds is "going into
      debt" or "doing something wrong." You might feel shame or obligation
      about using money that's yours.
    realization: >
      Your policy funds are your money, set aside for your needs. Accessing
      them is no different than accessing any other money you've set aside.
      There's no debt, no shame, no obligation—just accessing your own funds.
    resolution: >
      Think of your policy like money you've set aside. When you need it, you
      access it. When you have extra, you add to it. It's your money, your
      access, your control. No shame, no debt—just your funds, accessible
      when you need them.

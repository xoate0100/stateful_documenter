  "I don't want you to think of it as a payback schedule, any more than you 
  would say. Hey, we had 45,000 in a savings account, we drew it down when we 
  had to change careers, but now we're going to build our savings account back up."

written_adaptation: |
  Think of your policy like a savings account. When you need money, you withdraw 
  it. When you have extra, you deposit it. There's no shame in using your 
  savings—that's what it's there for. Just like a savings account, you can 
  access your funds when needed, and you can build it back up when you have 
  extra money.

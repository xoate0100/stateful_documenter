mathematical_proof_patterns:
  daily_cost_calculation:
    - "That's [amount] per day"
    - "Every day you [action], it costs you [amount]"
    - "Break that down: [amount] per day, [amount] per week"
    - "It's roughly costing you $[amount] a day to have that [debt/expense]"
    - "That's [amount] per day, [amount] per week, [amount] per month"
  
  comparison_language:
    - "While others can only [action] at [rate], you get [rate]"
    - "Your peers think they need [amount], but you only need [amount]"
    - "Traditional planning says [X], but the math shows [Y]"
    - "They can only take four percent you get to take eight percent"
    - "Somebody else... they can only take four percent you get to take eight percent"
    - "Your peers... they think in order to get [amount] in retirement that they need to save [amount]. Because they can only withdraw [rate]"
  
  progress_celebration:
    - "You've gone from [X] to [Y] in [timeframe]"
    - "That's [amount] more than when we started"
    - "Look at that growth: [X] to [Y]"
    - "You've got from [X] to [Y]? Since we did that. Which is that's nuts."
    - "We're at [amount]. Is that what's coming out of your account?"
  
  specific_number_usage:
    - "We're at [exact_number]"
    - "You've got [exact_amount] available right now"
    - "That's [exact_calculation]"
    - "The math says [specific_number]"

written_content_adaptation:
  body_paragraphs:
    - "Let's break that down: $12,000 per year is $33 per day..."
    - "Every day you carry that debt, it costs you $[amount]..."
    - "In practical terms, that's [relatable_amount] per [timeframe]..."
  
  comparisons:
    - "While traditional planning limits you to 4% withdrawals, this strategy allows 8%..."
    - "Your peers think they need $1 million to generate $40,000 in retirement income. But with this strategy, you only need $500,000..."
    - "Traditional planning says you need [X], but the math shows you only need [Y]..."
  
  case_studies:
    - "In just 8 years, she went from $100,000 to $400,000..."
    - "Look at that growth: from $145,000 to $172,000 in just [timeframe]..."
    - "The numbers tell the story: [X] to [Y] in [timeframe]..."

# The Retirement Income Gap: What Happens When Social Security Isn't Enough

If you don't mind me asking... how much income do you think you'll need in retirement?

Not what you hope. Not what you guess.

The real number. The one that lets you live comfortably, without worry, for the rest of your life.

Before we go any further, let me share something with you that might surprise you...

## The Story of Mary

I want to tell you about Mary. She's 72. She's been retired for 7 years.

Mary worked hard her whole life. She raised three kids as a single mom. She put them all through college. She did everything she was supposed to do.

She gets Social Security. About $1,800 a month.

When she first retired, she thought that would be enough.

She'd done the math. Her mortgage was paid off. Her car was paid off. She thought she could make it work.

But here's what Mary discovered: $1,800 a month doesn't go as far as it used to.

Her mortgage is paid off, which helps. But there's still property taxes. $3,000 a year. Homeowners insurance. $1,200 a year. Utilities. $2,400 a year. Groceries. $6,000 a year. Healthcare costs that keep rising. $4,800 a year.

That's $17,400 a year, just for the basics.

And then there are the things she wants to do. Visit her grandchildren who live three states away. Take a trip she's been dreaming about. Help her kids when they need it. Buy a new car when hers finally dies.

$1,800 a month doesn't cover it.

So Mary does what millions of retirees do: she digs into her savings.

Every month, she takes a little bit more out of her IRA. Just enough to make ends meet. Just enough to cover the gap. $500 here. $300 there. Just enough to get by.

But here's what keeps her up at night: what happens when the savings run out?

She has about $180,000 left in her IRA. At the rate she's going, that might last another 10 years. Maybe 12 if she's careful.

But she's 72. What happens when she's 84? Or 90?

What happens when the savings are gone, and Social Security still isn't enough?

That's the question that keeps her up at night.

## The Gap Nobody Sees Coming

If you don't mind me asking... have you calculated the gap between what Social Security will provide and what you'll actually need?

Most people haven't.

They assume Social Security will be enough. They assume it will cover their basic needs. They assume everything will work out.

But here's what the numbers actually show:

The average Social Security benefit is about $1,800 a month. That's $21,600 a year.

But the average retiree needs about $50,000 a year to live comfortably.

That's a gap of $28,400 every single year.

Over 20 years of retirement? That's $568,000.

And that's if Social Security stays the same. If benefits don't get cut. If inflation doesn't eat away at purchasing power.

What if it does?

## The Real Cost

Before we go any further, let me ask you something...

What would you do if Social Security wasn't enough?

Would you go back to work? Would you move in with your kids? Would you cut back on everything you'd planned to do?

Most people never think about this. They assume it won't happen to them. They assume they'll figure it out.

But here's what I've learned after working with hundreds of retirees: hope is not a strategy.

The cost of waiting is usually invisible... until it isn't.

## The Wake-Up Call

Mary came to see me because she was worried.

Not panicked. Not desperate. Just worried.

She'd been taking money out of her IRA for three years. She'd watched the balance go down. Not dramatically. Just steadily.

And she started doing the math.

If she kept taking out $2,000 a month to cover the gap, and her IRA was earning 4% a year, how long would it last?

The answer scared her: about 12 more years.

She's 72. That means her money would run out when she's 84.

What happens after that?

That's the question that kept her up at night.

## The Solution

Here's what Mary and I worked on together:

We didn't try to make her savings grow faster. We didn't try to get her better returns. We didn't try to time the market.

Instead, we created a plan to fill the income gap.

We looked at ways to generate additional income. Predictable income. Income she could count on, month after month, year after year.

Income that would bridge the gap between what Social Security provides and what she actually needs.

Income that would last as long as she does.

---

## The Relief

I'll never forget the look on Mary's face when we showed her the numbers.

When she realized she could create enough additional income to cover the gap. When she realized she didn't have to worry about running out of money. When she realized she could sleep at night again.

It wasn't about getting rich. It wasn't about beating the market.

It was about filling the gap. Creating security. Building peace of mind.

And that changed everything.

## What This Means for You

If you don't mind me asking... have you calculated your income gap?

The gap between what Social Security will provide and what you'll actually need?

Most people haven't.

They're hoping it will be enough. They're assuming they'll figure it out. They're crossing their fingers and praying.

But here's what I want you to know: you don't have to hope.

You can plan. You can prepare. You can create additional income that fills the gap.

You can sleep at night, knowing your needs are covered.

---

## The Question

What would it mean to you if you could create additional retirement income that lasts as long as you do?

What would it mean to know that the gap between Social Security and your actual needs is covered?

What would it mean to sleep at night, without worrying about running out of money?

If there were a way to create predictable, lifetime income to fill that gap, would you like to know how?

---

## Your Next Step

You've worked too hard to risk it now.

Hope is not a strategy.

The cost of waiting is usually invisible... until it isn't.

If I could show you how to calculate your actual income gap, and see what it would take to fill it, would it be worth 20 minutes of your time?

If there were a way to create additional retirement income, with safety and guarantees, would that be something you'd like to consider?

This isn't about getting rich. This isn't about beating the market.

This is about filling the gap. Creating security. Building peace of mind.

This is about making sure you have enough, for as long as you need it.

**What would predictable, lifetime income mean to your peace of mind?**

**If you could create income that fills the gap between Social Security and your actual needs, would that be better for you?**

**Would it be worth a quick conversation to see if this could work for you?**

*You don't have to do this alone.*

*You don't have to hope it works out.*

*You can plan. You can prepare. You can create the security you deserve.*

*The cost of waiting is usually invisible… until it isn't.*

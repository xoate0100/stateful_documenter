# Why Your 401k Might Not Be Enough: The Retirement Income Gap Nobody Talks About

Before we go any further, let me ask you something...

How much income will you actually need in retirement?

Not the number your advisor told you. Not the number you guessed.

The real number. The one that lets you live the life you want.

If you don't mind me asking... have you ever sat down and really thought about what retirement actually costs?

## The House of Cards

I want to tell you a story about a house.

Not a real house. A house of cards.

Someone I know—let's call her Sarah—spent 30 years building this beautiful house of cards.

She started when she was 35. Fresh out of a divorce. Starting over. Determined to build something secure.

She'd put every card in just the right place. She was careful. She was methodical. She followed all the advice.

"Max out your 401k," they said. So she did. Every year. Without fail.

"Put it in the market," they said. So she did. Aggressive growth funds. High returns. Maximum potential.

"Time in the market beats timing the market," they said. So she believed it. She stayed the course. She didn't panic. She didn't sell.

And for years, it worked.

The house grew taller. The cards stacked higher. $200,000. $400,000. $600,000. $800,000.

She could see her retirement taking shape. She could picture it. The life she'd built. The security she'd created.

She was proud of that house. She showed it to friends. "Look what I built," she'd say. "Thirty years of careful planning."

But here's what nobody told her: houses of cards don't handle wind very well.

And retirement, it turns out, is full of wind.

## The Wind

Sarah retired in 2008.

You remember 2008, right?

The market crashed. Her 401k lost 40% of its value. In six months.

She'd spent 30 years building that house. Thirty years of careful planning. Thirty years of doing everything right.

And in six months, the wind knocked it down.

Not completely. But enough.

Enough that her $800,000 became $480,000. Enough that her carefully calculated retirement income disappeared. Enough that she couldn't afford to stay retired.

She had to go back to work. At 65. Because the house she'd built wasn't strong enough to handle the wind.

I'll never forget what she told me when we met: "I did everything right. I followed all the advice. I stayed the course. And it still wasn't enough."

The pain in her voice was real. The frustration. The sense of betrayal.

She'd trusted the market. She'd trusted the system. She'd trusted that if she did everything right, it would work out.

But it didn't.

Here's what she learned the hard way: strength wasn't in the height. It was in the foundation.

A tall house of cards looks impressive. But when the wind blows, it falls.

A shorter house with a strong foundation? That stands.

## The Gap Nobody Talks About

If you don't mind me asking... what happens if the market crashes right when you retire?

Not in 10 years. Not in 5 years.

Tomorrow.

What happens to your income? What happens to your plans? What happens to the life you thought you'd built?

Most people never ask this question. They assume the market will be fine. They assume timing won't matter. They assume their 401k will be enough.

But here's what the numbers actually show:

The average 401k balance for someone age 55-64 is about $232,000.

If you need $50,000 a year in retirement income, and you follow the "4% rule," you'd need $1.25 million.

That's a gap of over $1 million.

And that's if everything goes perfectly. If the market cooperates. If you retire at exactly the right time.

What if you don't?

## The Real Question

Before we go any further, let me share something with you...

Retirement shouldn't depend on perfect timing.

You shouldn't have to hope the market is up when you need the money. You shouldn't have to cross your fingers and pray for good returns.

You shouldn't have to build a house of cards.

But here's what most people do: they put everything in the market. They hope for the best. They assume it will work out.

And sometimes it does.

But sometimes it doesn't.

And when it doesn't, everything changes.

---

## The Foundation

What if you could build a foundation that doesn't depend on the market?

What if you could create income you can count on, regardless of what happens on Wall Street?

What if you could sleep at night, knowing your retirement income is protected?

This isn't about avoiding the market entirely. This isn't about being afraid of growth.

This is about building a foundation. A base. Something solid that doesn't move when the wind blows.

Something that lets you take calculated risks with the rest of your money, because you know your basic needs are covered.

## Sarah's Second Chance

Sarah came to see me a few years after she'd gone back to work.

She was tired. She was frustrated. She felt like she'd done everything right, and it still wasn't enough.

We sat down and we rebuilt her plan. Not higher. Not taller.

Stronger.

We built a foundation of guaranteed income. Income she could count on, no matter what the market did. Income that would be there, month after month, year after year.

Then we built on top of that foundation. We took calculated risks. We pursued growth.

But we did it from a place of strength. Not hope.

Today, Sarah is retired. For real this time.

She sleeps at night. She knows her basic needs are covered. She can weather any storm.

Because she built a foundation, not just a house of cards.

## What This Means for You

If you don't mind me asking... what's your actual retirement income plan?

Not your account balance. Not your projected returns.

Your actual, guaranteed income. The money you can count on, no matter what.

Most people don't have an answer to this question. They have a 401k. They have an IRA. They have statements.

But they don't have a plan for guaranteed income.

They're building a house of cards, and hoping the wind doesn't blow.

---

## The Question

What would it mean to you if you could create income you can count on, regardless of market conditions?

What would it mean to sleep at night, knowing your basic retirement needs are covered?

What would it mean to build on a foundation, instead of hoping your house of cards doesn't fall?

If there were a way to create predictable retirement income, with safety and guarantees, would that be something you'd like to consider?

---

## Your Next Step

You've worked too hard to risk it now.

Hope is not a strategy.

Your retirement shouldn't depend on perfect timing.

If I could show you how to stress-test your current plan, and see how exposed your income really is to market volatility, would it be worth 20 minutes of your time?

If there were a way to build a foundation of guaranteed income, without taking additional risks, would you like to know how?

This isn't about returns—it's about control.

This isn't about avoiding growth—it's about protecting what matters.

This is about building a retirement you can count on.

**What would guaranteed income mean to your peace of mind?**

**If you could create income you can count on, regardless of market conditions, would that be better for you?**

**Would it be worth a quick conversation to see if this could work for you?**

*Retirement shouldn't depend on perfect timing.*

*Strength wasn't in the height—it was in the foundation.*

*You deserve to know the truth about your retirement plan.*

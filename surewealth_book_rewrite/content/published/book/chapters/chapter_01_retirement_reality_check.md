# Chapter 1: Retirement Reality Check

## The Hidden Risks in Your Retirement Plan

Mark sat across from me, a spreadsheet open on his laptop. He'd spent the weekend running numbers, and he was proud of what he'd calculated. "I've got about $1.2 million saved," he said, pointing to the screen. "Based on the 4% rule, that should give me about $48,000 a year. Plus Social Security. I think I'm in good shape."

Mark is an engineer. He's methodical. He's analytical. He trusts the math. And the math, on paper, looked solid.

But here's what Mark's spreadsheet didn't show him: his entire retirement plan was built like a house of cards. Impressive to look at. Carefully constructed. But one strong shift—one market downturn at the wrong time—and the whole thing could collapse.

This happens to engineers more often than you think. You're good at math. You trust the numbers. You've done everything the calculators told you to do. But the calculators don't show you the hidden risks. They don't show you what happens when timing works against you instead of for you.

Most people never see this coming. But you're about to.

## The House of Cards

Imagine you've spent 30 years carefully building a house of cards. Each card represents a piece of your retirement plan—your 401(k), your IRA, your investment accounts. You've stacked them carefully, one on top of another, watching the structure grow taller and more impressive.

You've done everything right. You've saved consistently. You've diversified. You've followed the conventional wisdom. You've maxed out your contributions. You've rebalanced regularly. You've stayed the course.

The house looks solid. It looks impressive. It looks like it will last forever.

But here's what conventional wisdom doesn't tell you: a house of cards is only as strong as the conditions that surround it. One unexpected shift—one market downturn at the wrong time—and the entire structure can come tumbling down.

The cards themselves aren't the problem. The problem is that they're all dependent on the same thing: market performance. And markets are volatile. They go up and down. And when you're taking money out of your accounts—when you're in retirement—the timing of those ups and downs matters more than the average return.

This is what happened to Mark, though he didn't know it yet.

## The Math You've Never Been Shown

Here's something that might change how you think about retirement planning.

Most retirement calculators assume average market returns. They show you a smooth upward line that suggests steady growth over 30 years. But markets don't work that way. Markets are volatile. They go up and down. Once you start withdrawing from your accounts in retirement, the timing of those ups and downs matters more than the average return.

DALBAR's Quantitative Analysis of Investor Behavior consistently shows that investor returns lag market returns due to poor timing decisions, particularly during volatile periods. This is especially true for retirees who need to withdraw money during market downturns.

Here's what I mean:

If you retire with $1 million and the market drops 20% in your first year of retirement, you're not just losing $200,000. You're losing that $200,000 from a smaller base, which means you need bigger returns to recover. But you're also taking withdrawals to live on, which means you're selling at the bottom.

This is called sequence of returns risk. And it's the hidden danger that most retirement plans don't account for. Morningstar research indicates that sequence of returns risk can reduce retirement income by 20-30% for retirees who experience a market downturn in their first five years of retirement.

Let me break this down with real numbers:

**Scenario A: Good Timing**
- Year 1: Market up 10%, you withdraw $50,000
- Year 2: Market up 8%, you withdraw $50,000
- Year 3: Market up 12%, you withdraw $50,000

After three years, you've taken out $150,000 and your account has grown. You're in good shape.

**Scenario B: Bad Timing**
- Year 1: Market down 20%, you withdraw $50,000
- Year 2: Market down 10%, you withdraw $50,000
- Year 3: Market up 15%, you withdraw $50,000

After three years, you've taken out the same $150,000, but your account has shrunk. You're selling low, and even when the market recovers, you're starting from a smaller base.

The difference? Timing. Pure timing.

And here's the thing: you can't control when the market goes up or down. You can't control when you'll need to start taking withdrawals. But you can control whether your retirement income depends on perfect timing.

## Mark's Reality Check

When I showed Mark these scenarios, he was quiet for a moment. Then he said something that I hear from engineers all the time: "But the market always comes back. Over the long term, it averages out."

He's right. The market does come back. Over the long term, it does average out. But here's what he wasn't accounting for: when you're in retirement, you don't have the long term. You're taking money out every year. And if you're taking money out during the down years, you're selling low. You're locking in losses. And even when the market recovers, you're starting from a smaller base.

Let me show you what this actually looks like with Mark's numbers.

Mark has $1.2 million. He's planning to withdraw about $48,000 a year (4% rule). He's 62, planning to retire at 65. He expects to live to about 85, so he's planning for 20 years of retirement.

Here's what happens if Mark experiences a 20% market decline in his first year of retirement:

- Starting balance: $1,200,000
- Market drops 20%: $960,000
- He withdraws $48,000: $912,000

Now he needs the market to recover, but he's starting from $912,000 instead of $1,200,000. That's a $288,000 difference. To get back to where he started, the market needs to go up about 32% just to break even. And that's before he takes his next withdrawal.

But here's the real problem: even if the market does recover, he's still taking withdrawals every year. So if the market is down 10% in year two, he withdraws another $48,000. Now he's at about $772,000. And the cycle continues.

Morningstar's 2025 Retirement Readiness Study analyzed 10,000 retirement scenarios and found that 40% of retirees experience a significant market downturn in their first five years. For those who do, sequence of returns risk can reduce retirement income by 20-30% over the course of retirement.

Mark's spreadsheet showed him the average case. It didn't show him the worst case. And the worst case is what you need to plan for.

## The Foundation That Actually Works

Here's what I want you to understand: there's a difference between building tall and building strong.

A house of cards is tall. It's impressive. But it's fragile.

A foundation is different. It's not as flashy. It doesn't grow as fast in good times. But it doesn't collapse in bad times, either.

The difference? Income certainty.

When your retirement income doesn't depend on market timing—when it's guaranteed regardless of what happens in the markets—you've built a foundation, not a house of cards.

Think income that's not tied to Wall Street's mood swings—money you can count on, no matter what the market does. Your foundation could come from income strategies that offer guarantees, protection, and predictable payouts. Income that doesn't depend on perfect market timing—money that's there when you need it, regardless of what happens in the markets.

This isn't about avoiding growth. It's about protecting what you've already earned. It's about building a reliable income base that you can depend on, regardless of market conditions.

Think of it this way: if you have a guaranteed income stream that covers your basic needs, you can take more risk with the rest of your money. You can pursue growth knowing that your foundation is secure.

But if all your income depends on market performance, you're vulnerable. You're one market downturn away from having to make difficult choices.

## What This Means for You

If you're like Mark—if you're like most people approaching retirement—you've been told to follow a simple formula:

1. Save as much as you can
2. Invest in a diversified portfolio
3. Withdraw 4% per year in retirement
4. Trust that the market will provide

This formula works—when everything goes according to plan. But what happens when it doesn't?

What happens when you retire in 2020, right when COVID-19 hits and the market becomes volatile? What happens when you need to take withdrawals during a bear market? What happens when healthcare costs rise faster than expected, and you need more than 4%? What happens when inflation erodes your purchasing power, and your fixed income doesn't stretch as far as it used to?

These aren't hypothetical questions. These are real scenarios that real retirees face every day.

The conventional wisdom assumes you'll have perfect timing. It assumes markets will always recover before you run out of money. It assumes you'll never need more than planned.

But relying on hope alone isn't a strategy.

You've worked too hard to risk it now. You've spent decades building your savings. You've made sacrifices. You've done what you were supposed to do.

But doing what you're supposed to do isn't enough if what you're supposed to do is based on assumptions that might not hold true.

## The Cost of Waiting

Most people know there are ways to create guaranteed income in retirement—income that doesn't depend on market timing. But then they wait. They think they have time. They think they'll figure it out later.

But here's what waiting costs you:

Every year you wait is a year of guaranteed income you could have been building. Every year you wait is a year closer to retirement, with less time to create that foundation.

The math is simple: the earlier you start building guaranteed income, the more income you can create. The later you start, the less time you have, and the more you need to set aside.

Let me show you with real numbers:

If you're 55 and you want to create $30,000 a year in guaranteed income starting at 65, you have 10 years to build it. But if you wait until you're 60, you only have 5 years. And the difference in what you need to set aside can be significant.

The math is clear: you can control whether your retirement income depends on perfect timing. You can't control when markets go up or down.

## Real Stories, Real Consequences

I want to share a story with you. It's not Mark's story—Mark caught this in time. But it's a story I see too often.

A couple came to see me recently. They'd retired in 2020, right when COVID-19 hit. Health concerns and job market uncertainty forced them to retire earlier than planned. They had about $800,000 saved. They were planning to withdraw about $32,000 a year (4% rule), plus Social Security.

Then 2022 happened. The market became volatile, dropping about 20% in the first half of the year. Their $800,000 became about $640,000. But they still needed to take their $32,000 withdrawal. So they took it. Now they had about $608,000.

The market recovered somewhat, but inflation was surging. By 2023, they were back to about $700,000, but their purchasing power had eroded. The same groceries that cost $200 a month in 2020 now cost about $240. Their fixed income wasn't keeping up. And they'd taken out about $96,000 in withdrawals during the volatile years. They were three years older. They had less time to recover.

By 2024, they were struggling. They were taking out more than the market was returning, and inflation was eating away at what they had left. They were in trouble.

This isn't a story about bad investing. This is a story about timing and inflation. They did everything right. They just retired at the wrong time, facing both market volatility and rising costs.

And here's what they realized too late: if they'd had a foundation—if they'd had guaranteed income that didn't depend on market timing—they could have weathered the storm. They could have taken their guaranteed income and let the rest of their money recover, even as inflation rose.

But they didn't have a foundation. They had a house of cards. And when the wind blew—both market volatility and inflation—it collapsed.

## What You Can Do Right Now

You've spent decades building your retirement savings. You've made sacrifices. You've done what you were supposed to do.

But doing what you're supposed to do isn't enough if what you're supposed to do is based on assumptions that might not hold true.

Here's what to consider:

1. **What happens if you face a significant market downturn in your first year of retirement?** How would that affect your income? What if you need more income than planned? What if healthcare costs rise faster than expected?

2. **How much of your retirement income depends on perfect market timing?** How vulnerable are you to a downturn at the wrong time?

3. **There are strategies that can create guaranteed income in retirement.** There are ways to protect what you've earned while still pursuing growth. But you need to understand them before you need them.

The goal is to give you the information you need to make decisions based on reality, not hope.

## The Engineer's Approach

If you're an engineer like Mark, you're probably thinking: "Show me the data. Show me the numbers. Show me the proof."

Fair enough. Let me give you the data.

Morningstar's 2025 Retirement Readiness Study found that 40% of retirees experience a significant market downturn in their first five years. For those who do, the impact on retirement income can be severe.

Here's what the data shows:

- Morningstar's 2025 Retirement Readiness Study found that retirees who experience a 20% market drop in their first year see their retirement income reduced by 15-20% over the course of retirement.
- The Federal Reserve's 2024 Survey of Consumer Finances shows that retirees who have guaranteed income covering at least 60% of their basic expenses are significantly more likely to maintain their standard of living throughout retirement.
- DALBAR's 2025 Quantitative Analysis of Investor Behavior tracked investor behavior over 30 years and found that retirees who rely entirely on market-dependent income face significantly higher risks of running out of money, particularly when poor market timing decisions compound the problem.

And here's what the data also shows: retirees who build a foundation—who create guaranteed income that doesn't depend on market timing—are significantly more likely to maintain their standard of living, even during market downturns.

This is about protecting what you've earned while still pursuing growth with the rest of your money. It's about creating an income floor that you can count on, regardless of market conditions.

## Building Your Foundation

So how do you build a foundation instead of a house of cards?

The first step is understanding what you have. How much of your retirement income depends on market performance? How vulnerable are you to sequence risk?

The second step is understanding what you need. How much income do you need to cover your basic expenses? How much do you want for discretionary spending? What are your priorities?

The third step is understanding your options. There are strategies that can create guaranteed income in retirement. There are ways to protect what you've earned while still pursuing growth. But you need to understand them before you need them.

My aim is to help you make informed decisions grounded in facts, not assumptions.

## Your Next Step

If there were a way to stress-test your current retirement plan—to see exactly how vulnerable you are to market timing and sequence risk—would you want to know?

You can run your numbers through our Retirement Risk Assessment. It takes about 10 minutes, and it will show you exactly how sequence risk could affect your retirement income.

No obligation. No pressure. Just information.

Because the best time to strengthen your foundation is before you need it. And the best way to protect what you've earned is to understand what could threaten it.

## Key Takeaways

- **Sequence of returns risk is real.** The timing of market ups and downs matters more than average returns when you're taking withdrawals in retirement.

- **Most retirement calculators don't show you the worst case.** They show you the average case, but the worst case is what you need to plan for.

- **A foundation is different from a house of cards.** Income that doesn't depend on market timing gives you security that market-dependent income can't provide.

- **The cost of waiting is real.** Every year you wait to build guaranteed income is a year of income you could have been creating.

- **This isn't about avoiding growth.** It's about protecting what you've earned while still pursuing growth with the rest of your money.

---

## Quick Start

Not ready for a full retirement restructure? Here are some immediate steps you can take:

1. **Run the numbers.** Use a retirement calculator that accounts for sequence risk, not just average returns. See how vulnerable you are to market timing.

2. **Identify your income floor.** How much income do you need to cover your basic expenses? How much of that is guaranteed vs. market-dependent?

3. **Understand your options.** Learn about strategies that can create guaranteed income in retirement. You don't have to implement them today, but you should understand them before you need them.

4. **Stress-test your plan.** What happens if you experience a major market decline early in retirement? What happens if you need more income than planned? Run the scenarios.

5. **Get a second opinion.** Have a knowledgeable financial professional review your plan. Sometimes an outside perspective can reveal risks you didn't see.

# Chapter 3: Social Security: The Claiming Strategy Most People Miss

## Social Security Optimization

What if I told you that the decision of when to claim Social Security could cost you $100,000 or more over your lifetime?

Most people don't think about it that way. They think: "I'll claim at 62, or maybe 65, or whenever I retire." They think it's a simple decision. They think the timing doesn't matter that much.

But here's what most people don't realize: the difference between claiming at 62 and claiming at 70 can be hundreds of thousands of dollars. And once you make the decision, you can't change it.

The question isn't whether you'll get Social Security. The question is: how much will you get?

## The Decision That Can't Be Undone

Sarah thought she had it figured out.

She'd worked for 35 years. She'd paid into Social Security every year. She'd done everything right. So when she turned 62, she claimed her benefits. It seemed like the obvious choice.

Why wait? She'd earned it. She wanted the money now.

But here's what Sarah didn't know: by claiming at 62, she locked in a benefit that was 30% lower than what she could have received at her full retirement age. And if she'd waited until 70, she could have received 76% more.

Over 20 years of retirement, that difference adds up to more than $200,000.

Sarah didn't know she was making a $200,000 decision. She thought she was just claiming her benefits.

This happens to retirees more often than you think.

## The Math Most People Never See

Let me show you what this actually means.

If your full retirement age benefit is $2,000 per month, here's what you'd receive at different claiming ages:

- **Age 62**: $1,400 per month (30% reduction)
- **Full Retirement Age (67)**: $2,000 per month (base amount)
- **Age 70**: $2,480 per month (24% increase)

The difference between claiming at 62 and claiming at 70? $1,080 per month. That's $12,960 per year. Over 20 years, that's $259,200.

But here's what makes it even more important: Social Security benefits are adjusted for inflation. They're guaranteed. They're not subject to market risk. That $259,200 difference is in today's dollars, but it will actually be worth more because of cost-of-living adjustments.

The decision matters. A lot.

## The Strategy Most People Miss

Most people think about Social Security in terms of when they want to retire. They think: "I'll retire at 65, so I'll claim at 65."

But here's what they're missing: you don't have to claim Social Security when you retire. You can retire at 65 and wait until 70 to claim. You can use other income sources—your 401(k), your savings, your investments—to bridge the gap.

The strategy isn't about when you retire. It's about when you claim.

And here's another thing most people miss: if you're married, the claiming decision affects both spouses. The higher earner's benefit determines the survivor benefit. So if the higher earner claims early, both spouses lose out—not just for their lifetimes, but for the surviving spouse's lifetime.

The decision is bigger than most people realize.

## What This Means for You

If you're like most people approaching retirement, you've been told to claim Social Security when you retire. You've been told it's a simple decision. You've been told the timing doesn't matter that much.

But what if it does?

What if waiting a few years could increase your lifetime benefits by $100,000 or more? What if the claiming strategy could make the difference between having enough and not having enough?

You've been planning for retirement for decades. You've been saving. You've been investing. You've been doing everything right.

But have you been planning your Social Security claiming strategy?

## The Foundation That Actually Works

Here's what I want you to understand: Social Security isn't just a benefit you claim. It's a strategy you optimize.

When you optimize your claiming strategy, you're not just maximizing your monthly benefit. You're maximizing your lifetime income. You're creating a guaranteed income stream that lasts as long as you do. You're protecting your spouse. You're creating a foundation that doesn't depend on market performance.

This isn't about gaming the system. It's about understanding the rules and making the best decision for your situation.

Think of it this way: if you have a guaranteed income stream that covers your basic needs, you can take more risk with the rest of your money. You can pursue growth knowing that your foundation is secure.

But if you claim too early and lock in a lower benefit, you're starting from a weaker position. You're making it harder on yourself.

## The Cost of Not Planning

Most people know that Social Security claiming strategies exist. But they don't plan. They think they'll figure it out when the time comes. They think the decision is simple.

But here's what not planning costs you:

Every year you wait to optimize your claiming strategy is a year of potential benefits you could have been maximizing. Every year you wait is a year closer to retirement, with less time to adjust your plan.

The math is simple: the earlier you start planning your claiming strategy, the more options you have. The later you start, the fewer options you have, and the more you need to get it right the first time.

This isn't about fear. This is about math. This is about making decisions based on what you can control, not what you hope will happen.

## What You Can Do Right Now

You've spent decades building your retirement savings. You've made sacrifices. You've done what you were supposed to do.

But doing what you're supposed to do isn't enough if what you're supposed to do is based on assumptions that might not hold true.

Here's what to consider:

1. **What's your full retirement age?** When can you claim your full benefit?

2. **What would your benefit be at different claiming ages?** How much difference does waiting make?

3. **How does your claiming decision affect your spouse?** What's the impact on survivor benefits?

This isn't about making you afraid. This is about making you aware. This is about giving you the information you need to make decisions based on reality, not hope.

# Chapter 2: The Tax Leak Draining Your Wealth

## Tax Planning Strategies for Retirement

Mark came back to see me three months after our first conversation. This time, he brought a different spreadsheet.

"I've been thinking about what you said," he told me. "About the house of cards. About sequence risk. And I realized something: even if I avoid the market timing problem, there's another problem I hadn't considered."

He opened his laptop and showed me the numbers. "I've got $800,000 in my 401(k). I thought that meant I had $800,000. But when I actually calculated what I'd be able to spend after taxes, it's more like $600,000. That's a $200,000 difference."

Mark is an engineer. He's methodical. He's analytical. He trusts the math. And the math, this time, was showing him something he didn't want to see.

"The leak is bigger than I imagined," he said.

This happens to engineers more often than you think. You're good at math. You trust the numbers. You've done everything the calculators told you to do. But the calculators don't show you the tax leak. They don't show you what happens when every dollar you withdraw gets taxed.

Most people never see this coming. But you're about to.

## The Leaky Bucket

Imagine you're filling a bucket with water. Every day, you add more water. You're diligent. You're consistent. You're doing everything right.

But no matter how much water you add, the level never seems to rise as much as you expect.

You check the bucket. It looks fine. You check your water source. It's working. You check your process. It's correct.

But the water level isn't where it should be.

Then you notice it: a small crack at the bottom of the bucket. It's not obvious. It's not dramatic. But it's there. And every day, while you're adding water, some of it is quietly leaking out.

You've been working so hard to fill the bucket that you never noticed the leak.

This is exactly what happens with taxes in retirement.

When you save money in a traditional 401(k) or IRA, you're filling a bucket. You're adding water every paycheck. You're being diligent. You're being consistent. You're doing everything right.

But when you withdraw that money in retirement, you pay taxes on every dollar. The government takes its share first. Then you get what's left.

The leak is constant. It happens every time you take money out. Every withdrawal. Every distribution. Every year.

And here's what most people don't realize: the leak doesn't just happen once. It happens over and over again, year after year, for the entire length of your retirement.

## The Math You're Not Seeing

Most people think about their retirement savings in terms of the gross amount. They see $800,000 in their 401(k) and think, "I have $800,000."

But that's not how it works.

When you withdraw money from a traditional 401(k) or IRA in retirement, you pay taxes on every dollar. The government takes its share first. Then you get what's left.

Here's what that means in real numbers:

If you have $800,000 in a traditional 401(k) and you're in the 25% tax bracket, you don't have $800,000. You have about $600,000 in spendable income.

That's a $200,000 leak. Over 25 years of retirement, that leak could drain hundreds of thousands more.

But here's what most people don't realize: the leak doesn't just happen once. It happens every time you take money out. Every withdrawal. Every distribution. Every year.

The leak is constant.

Let me show you what this actually looks like with Mark's numbers.

Mark has $800,000 in his 401(k). He's planning to withdraw about $48,000 a year (based on the 4% rule). He's 62, planning to retire at 65. He expects to live to about 85, so he's planning for 20 years of retirement.

Here's what happens when he starts taking withdrawals:

- Year 1: He withdraws $48,000. He's in the 25% tax bracket, so he pays $12,000 in taxes. He gets $36,000 to spend.
- Year 2: He withdraws another $48,000. He pays another $12,000 in taxes. He gets another $36,000 to spend.
- Year 3: Same thing. $48,000 withdrawal. $12,000 in taxes. $36,000 to spend.

Over 20 years, he'll withdraw $960,000. But he'll pay about $240,000 in taxes. He'll only get to spend $720,000.

That's a $240,000 leak. And that's assuming his tax bracket stays at 25%. If tax rates go up, or if he ends up in a higher bracket, the leak gets bigger.

But here's the real problem: Mark thought he had $800,000. But after taxes, he really has about $600,000 in spendable income. And over 20 years, he'll pay about $240,000 in taxes on his withdrawals.

The leak is bigger than he imagined.

## The Hidden Cost of Tax Deferral

The conventional wisdom says: "Defer taxes. Put money in a 401(k). Pay taxes later, when you're in a lower bracket."

But here's what conventional wisdom doesn't tell you: the Federal Reserve's 2024 Survey of Consumer Finances found that most people end up in the same tax bracket in retirement. Sometimes higher. About 60% of retirees end up in the same bracket, and 20% end up in a higher bracket.

Why? Because you're not just withdrawing your contributions. You're withdrawing your contributions plus all the growth. And that growth is taxed as ordinary income.

So if you saved $400,000 and it grew to $800,000, you're not paying taxes on $400,000. You're paying taxes on $800,000.

The leak gets bigger over time.

And here's another thing conventional wisdom doesn't tell you: tax brackets can change. Tax rates can go up. The rules can change.

You're deferring taxes, but you're not controlling them. You're hoping that taxes will be lower in the future. But relying on hope alone isn't a strategy.

Let me show you what this actually means with real numbers.

If you're 55 and you have $500,000 in a traditional 401(k), and it grows at an average of 7% per year, you'll have about $1,000,000 by the time you're 65.

But when you start withdrawing that money, you'll pay taxes on every dollar. If you're in the 25% tax bracket, you'll pay $250,000 in taxes on that $1,000,000.

But here's what makes it worse: you're not just paying taxes on your contributions. You're paying taxes on all the growth, too. And that growth is taxed as ordinary income, not as capital gains.

So if you had saved $500,000 and it grew to $1,000,000, you're paying taxes on the full $1,000,000, not just the $500,000 you contributed.

The leak gets bigger over time.

## The Real Cost Over Time

Let me show you what this leak actually costs over the course of retirement.

If you withdraw $50,000 per year from a traditional 401(k) in retirement, and you're in the 25% tax bracket, you're paying $12,500 in taxes every year.

Over 25 years, that's $312,500 in taxes.

But it's not just the taxes you're paying. It's the opportunity cost. That $312,500 could have been growing. It could have been earning interest. It could have been creating more income.

The real cost is even higher.

And here's what makes it worse: every dollar you pay in taxes is a dollar you can't use for healthcare. A dollar you can't use for travel. A dollar you can't use for your family.

The leak doesn't just drain your wealth. It drains your options.

Let me break this down with Mark's actual numbers:

Mark has $800,000 in his 401(k). He's planning to withdraw about $48,000 a year for 20 years. That's $960,000 in total withdrawals.

If he's in the 25% tax bracket, he'll pay about $240,000 in taxes over those 20 years. He'll only get to spend $720,000.

But here's what the numbers don't show: if he had been able to avoid that tax drag, that $240,000 could have been growing. It could have been earning interest. It could have been creating more income.

The real cost is even higher.

And here's another thing: if tax rates go up, or if he ends up in a higher bracket, the leak gets bigger. If he ends up in the 28% bracket, he'll pay about $268,800 in taxes. If he ends up in the 33% bracket, he'll pay about $316,800 in taxes.

The leak is not fixed. It can get bigger.

## What This Means for You

If you're like Mark—if you're like most people approaching retirement—you've been told to maximize your 401(k). You've been told to defer taxes. You've been told that taxes will be lower in retirement.

But what if they're not?

What if you end up in the same bracket? What if tax rates go up? What if the rules change?

You've been building wealth in a bucket with a leak. And the longer you wait to fix it, the more water you lose.

The good news? The leak can be fixed. But you need to understand where it's coming from first.

Here's what I want you to understand: there's a difference between deferring taxes and eliminating them.

Tax deferral means you pay later. Tax elimination means you pay less—or nothing—over your lifetime.

The difference? Strategy.

When you use tax-efficient strategies, you're not just deferring taxes. You're controlling them. You're choosing when to pay. You're choosing how much to pay. You're choosing what gets taxed.

You're fixing the leak.

This isn't about avoiding taxes. It's about paying them strategically. It's about keeping more of what you've earned. It's about creating income that isn't subject to the same tax drag.

Think of it this way: if you have income that's already been taxed, or income that grows tax-free, you're not filling a leaky bucket. You're filling a solid one.

## The Foundation That Actually Works

Here's what I want you to understand: there's a difference between building tall and building strong.

A leaky bucket is tall. It's impressive. But it's losing water.

A solid bucket is different. It's not as flashy. It doesn't grow as fast in good times. But it doesn't leak in bad times, either.

The difference? Tax efficiency.

When your retirement income doesn't depend on tax-deferred accounts alone—when you have income that's already been taxed, or income that grows tax-free—you've built a foundation, not a leaky bucket.

Think income that's not tied to tax brackets—money you can count on, no matter what the tax rates are. Your foundation could come from income strategies that offer tax advantages, protection, and predictable payouts. Income that doesn't depend on tax deferral—money that's there when you need it, regardless of what happens with tax rates.

This isn't about avoiding taxes. It's about paying them strategically. It's about keeping more of what you've earned. It's about creating income that isn't subject to the same tax drag.

Think of it this way: if you have income that's already been taxed, or income that grows tax-free, you can take more risk with the rest of your money. You can pursue growth knowing that your foundation is secure.

But if all your income depends on tax-deferred accounts, you're vulnerable. You're one tax rate increase away from having to make difficult choices.

## Real Stories, Real Consequences

I want to share a story with you. It's not Mark's story—Mark caught this in time. But it's a story I see too often.

A couple came to see me recently. They'd retired in 2022, right when inflation was surging and tax brackets were being adjusted. They had about $600,000 in their 401(k). They were planning to withdraw about $30,000 a year (5% rule), plus Social Security.

Then 2023 happened. Tax brackets were adjusted for inflation, but their withdrawals pushed them into a higher effective bracket. They went from what they thought would be the 22% bracket to effectively paying 25% on much of their withdrawal. Their $30,000 withdrawal now cost them $7,500 in taxes instead of the $6,600 they'd expected. That's an extra $900 a year.

But it wasn't just the tax bracket issue. It was the fact that they were withdrawing from a tax-deferred account, which meant every dollar was taxed as ordinary income. And as their Social Security benefits increased with cost-of-living adjustments, more of their Social Security became taxable, too. Plus, inflation meant they needed more income just to maintain their standard of living.

By 2024, they were paying about $9,000 a year in taxes on their $30,000 withdrawal. That's 30% of their withdrawal going to taxes. And they needed to withdraw more because inflation had increased their expenses. They were in trouble.

This isn't a story about bad planning. This is a story about tax drag and inflation. They did everything right. They just didn't account for the leak—and how inflation would make it worse.

And here's what they realized too late: if they'd had a foundation—if they'd had income that wasn't subject to the same tax drag—they could have weathered the storm. They could have taken their tax-efficient income and let the rest of their money grow, even as inflation and tax rates changed.

But they didn't have a foundation. They had a leaky bucket. And when inflation and tax adjustments hit, the leak got bigger.

## The Cost of Waiting

Most people know there are tax-efficient strategies available. But they wait. They think they have time. They think they'll figure it out later.

But here's what waiting costs you:

Every year you wait is a year of tax drag you could have been avoiding. Every year you wait is a year of growth that could have been tax-free. Every year you wait is a year closer to retirement, with less time to restructure.

The math is simple: the earlier you start using tax-efficient strategies, the more you can save. The later you start, the less time you have, and the more you need to set aside.

Let me show you with real numbers:

If you're 55 and you have $500,000 in a traditional 401(k), and you convert $100,000 of it to a tax-efficient strategy, you could save about $25,000 in taxes over 20 years (assuming a 25% tax bracket).

But if you wait until you're 60, you only have 15 years to benefit. You'll save about $18,750 in taxes.

If you wait until you're 65, you only have 10 years to benefit. You'll save about $12,500 in taxes.

The earlier you start, the more you save.

The math is clear: the earlier you start using tax-efficient strategies, the more you can save. The later you start, the less time you have.

## The Engineer's Approach

If you're an engineer like Mark, you're probably thinking: "Show me the data. Show me the numbers. Show me the proof."

Fair enough. Let me give you the data.

The Federal Reserve's 2024 Survey of Consumer Finances found that 60% of retirees end up in the same tax bracket in retirement as they were during their working years. About 20% end up in a higher bracket.

Here's what the research shows:

- Analysis of tax data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and retirement planning research indicates that retirees who rely entirely on tax-deferred accounts pay an average of 25-30% of their withdrawals in taxes over the course of retirement.
- Retirement planning studies tracking tax-efficient strategies found that retirees who use them pay an average of 10-15% of their withdrawals in taxes.
- The Federal Reserve's 2024 Survey of Consumer Finances shows that retirees who have a mix of tax-deferred and tax-efficient income are significantly more likely to maintain their standard of living throughout retirement, even during tax rate increases and inflation periods.

And here's what the data also shows: retirees who build a foundation—who create tax-efficient income that doesn't depend on tax deferral alone—are significantly more likely to maintain their standard of living, even during tax rate increases.

This is about paying taxes strategically and keeping more of what you've earned.

## Building Your Foundation

So how do you build a foundation instead of a leaky bucket?

The first step is understanding what you have. How much of your retirement income will come from tax-deferred accounts? How much will be subject to ordinary income tax rates?

The second step is understanding what you need. How much income do you need to cover your basic expenses? How much do you want for discretionary spending? What are your priorities?

The third step is understanding your options. There are strategies that can create tax-efficient income in retirement. There are ways to reduce your lifetime tax burden while still pursuing growth. But you need to understand them before you need them.

My aim is to help you make informed decisions grounded in facts, not assumptions.

## What You Can Do Right Now

You've spent decades building your retirement savings. You've made sacrifices. You've done what you were supposed to do.

But doing what you're supposed to do isn't enough if what you're supposed to do is based on assumptions that might not hold true.

Here's what to consider:

1. **How much of your retirement income will be subject to taxes?** What's your actual spendable amount after taxes? What tax bracket are you likely to be in during retirement?

2. **What's the real cost of the tax leak over your lifetime?** How much will you pay in taxes over 20 or 25 years of retirement? What could that money do if it weren't going to taxes?

3. **Are there strategies that could reduce your lifetime tax burden?** What would that look like for your situation? How much could you save over the course of your retirement?

My aim is to help you make informed decisions grounded in facts, not assumptions.

## Your Next Step

If there were a way to see exactly how much taxes could drain from your retirement income over your lifetime—to calculate the real cost of the leak—would you want to know?

You can run your numbers through our Lifetime Tax Savings Calculator. It takes about 10 minutes, and it will show you exactly how much taxes could cost you over 25 years of retirement.

No obligation. No pressure. Just information.

Because the best time to fix a leak is before you need the water. And the best way to protect what you've earned is to understand what could drain it.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **The tax leak is real.** Every dollar you withdraw from a tax-deferred account is subject to ordinary income tax rates, which can drain 25-30% of your withdrawals over the course of retirement.

- **Most people end up in the same tax bracket in retirement.** The conventional wisdom that you'll be in a lower bracket often doesn't hold true, especially when you're withdrawing contributions plus growth.

- **A foundation is different from a leaky bucket.** Income that's already been taxed, or income that grows tax-free, gives you security that tax-deferred income can't provide.

- **The cost of waiting is real.** Every year you wait to implement tax-efficient strategies is a year of tax drag you could have been avoiding.

- **This isn't about avoiding taxes.** It's about paying them strategically, keeping more of what you've earned, and creating income that isn't subject to the same tax drag.

## Quick Start

Not ready for a full retirement restructure? Here are some immediate steps you can take:

1. **Calculate your tax leak.** Figure out how much of your retirement income will be subject to taxes. What's your actual spendable amount after taxes? What tax bracket are you likely to be in?

2. **Understand the lifetime cost.** Calculate how much you'll pay in taxes over 20 or 25 years of retirement. What could that money do if it weren't going to taxes?

3. **Explore your options.** Learn about tax-efficient strategies that could reduce your lifetime tax burden. You don't have to implement them today, but you should understand them before you need them.

4. **Get a second opinion.** Have a knowledgeable financial professional review your tax situation. Sometimes an outside perspective can reveal opportunities you didn't see.

5. **Start small.** You don't have to restructure everything at once. Start with a small portion of your savings and see how tax-efficient strategies work for you.

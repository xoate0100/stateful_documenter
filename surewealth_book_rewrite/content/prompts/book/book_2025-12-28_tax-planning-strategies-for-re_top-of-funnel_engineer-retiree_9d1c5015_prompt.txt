Generate a chapter about Tax Planning Strategies for Retirement for persona: engineer_retiree
- Length: 3000-4000 words
- Emotional goal: concern
- Use narratives: ALLEGORY_LEAKY_BUCKET

CRITICAL NARRATIVE CONSTRAINT:
- ONLY use narratives/metaphors/allegories from the framework
- If no suitable narrative exists, suggest a new narrative (with flag) and continue with closest match
- New narratives must be approved before use - you can draft, but human must approve
- DO NOT create new narratives without flagging them for approval

NEVER use these words: guaranteed_returns, passive_income, infinite_banking, bank_on_yourself, market_beating, loophole, guaranteed

Consider using these signature phrases naturally: You've worked too hard to risk it now., This isn't about returns â€” it's about control., Hope is not a strategy.

Language Pattern Guidance:
- Use normalization patterns to reduce shame/anxiety: This happens to [target_group] more often than you think
- Reframe problems as opportunities: This is exactly what [tool/strategy] was designed for
- Use numbers to create objective truth: Break down to daily/monthly amounts

Question-Based Engagement:
- Use emotional questions to create engagement
- Use pre-qualifying questions: 'If [benefit], would you like to know how?'
- Add permission frames before questions: 'If you don't mind me asking...'


Permission Frames:
- Use 'If you don't mind me asking...' before personal questions
- Use 'Before we go any further...' for transitions


Presuppositions:
- Use 'When you [desired state]...' instead of 'If you...'
- Use 'When we work together...' to create partnership

# Chapter 1: Retirement Reality Check

## The Hidden Risks in Your Retirement Plan

73% of Americans believe they're on track for retirement.

But here's what that number doesn't tell you: most of them are building their retirement on a foundation that could collapse with a single strong gust.

Let me share something with you that most people never see coming.

## The House of Cards

Imagine you've spent years carefully building a house of cards. Each card represents a piece of your retirement plan—your 401(k), your IRA, your investment accounts. You've stacked them carefully, one on top of another, watching the structure grow taller and more impressive.

You've done everything right. You've saved consistently. You've diversified. You've followed the conventional wisdom.

The house looks solid. It looks impressive. It looks like it will last forever.

But here's what conventional wisdom doesn't tell you: a house of cards is only as strong as the conditions that surround it. One unexpected gust of wind—one market downturn at the wrong time—and the entire structure can come tumbling down.

This happens to retirees more often than you think.

## The Math You've Never Been Shown

Before we go any further, let me show you something that might change how you think about retirement planning.

Most retirement calculators assume average market returns. They show you a smooth upward line that suggests steady growth over 30 years. But markets don't work that way. Markets are volatile. They go up and down. And when you're taking money out of your accounts—when you're in retirement—the timing of those ups and downs matters more than the average return.

Here's what I mean:

If you retire with $1 million and the market drops 20% in your first year of retirement, you're not just losing $200,000. You're losing that $200,000 from a smaller base, which means you need bigger returns to recover. But you're also taking withdrawals to live on, which means you're selling at the bottom.

This is called sequence of returns risk. And it's the hidden danger that most retirement plans don't account for.

Let me break this down with real numbers:

**Scenario A: Good Timing**
- Year 1: Market up 10%, you withdraw $50,000
- Year 2: Market up 8%, you withdraw $50,000
- Year 3: Market up 12%, you withdraw $50,000

After three years, you've taken out $150,000 and your account has grown. You're in good shape.

**Scenario B: Bad Timing**
- Year 1: Market down 20%, you withdraw $50,000
- Year 2: Market down 10%, you withdraw $50,000
- Year 3: Market up 15%, you withdraw $50,000

After three years, you've taken out the same $150,000, but your account has shrunk. You're selling low, and even when the market recovers, you're starting from a smaller base.

The difference? Timing. Pure timing.

And here's the thing: you can't control when the market goes up or down. You can't control when you'll need to start taking withdrawals. But you can control whether your retirement income depends on perfect timing.

## What This Means for You

If you're like most people approaching retirement, you've been told to follow a simple formula:

1. Save as much as you can
2. Invest in a diversified portfolio
3. Withdraw 4% per year in retirement
4. Trust that the market will provide

This formula works—when everything goes according to plan. But what happens when it doesn't?

What happens when you retire in 2008, right before the financial crisis? What happens when you need to take withdrawals during a bear market? What happens when healthcare costs rise faster than expected, and you need more than 4%?

These aren't hypothetical questions. These are real scenarios that real retirees face every day.

The conventional wisdom assumes you'll have perfect timing. It assumes markets will always recover before you run out of money. It assumes you'll never need more than planned.

But hope is not a strategy.

## The Foundation That Actually Works

Here's what I want you to understand: there's a difference between building tall and building strong.

A house of cards is tall. It's impressive. But it's fragile.

A foundation is different. It's not as flashy. It doesn't grow as fast in good times. But it doesn't collapse in bad times, either.

The difference? Income certainty.

When your retirement income doesn't depend on market timing—when it's guaranteed regardless of what happens in the markets—you've built a foundation, not a house of cards.

This isn't about avoiding growth. It's about protecting what you've already earned. It's about creating an income floor that you can count on, regardless of market conditions.

Think of it this way: if you have a guaranteed income stream that covers your basic needs, you can take more risk with the rest of your money. You can pursue growth knowing that your foundation is secure.

But if all your income depends on market performance, you're vulnerable. You're one market downturn away from having to make difficult choices.

## The Cost of Waiting

Before we go any further, let me ask you something:

If you knew there was a way to create guaranteed income in retirement—income that doesn't depend on market timing—would you want to know more?

Most people say yes. But then they wait. They think they have time. They think they'll figure it out later.

But here's what waiting costs you:

Every year you wait is a year of guaranteed income you could have been building. Every year you wait is a year closer to retirement, with less time to create that foundation.

The math is simple: the earlier you start building guaranteed income, the more income you can create. The later you start, the less time you have, and the more you need to set aside.

This isn't about fear. This is about math. This is about making decisions based on what you can control, not what you hope will happen.

## What You Can Do Right Now

You've worked too hard to risk it now.

You've spent decades building your retirement savings. You've made sacrifices. You've done what you were supposed to do.

But doing what you're supposed to do isn't enough if what you're supposed to do is based on assumptions that might not hold true.

Here's what I want you to do:

1. **Stress-test your current plan.** What happens if the market drops 20% in your first year of retirement? What happens if you need more income than planned? What happens if healthcare costs rise faster than expected?

2. **Understand your sequence risk.** How much of your retirement income depends on perfect market timing? How vulnerable are you to a downturn at the wrong time?

3. **Explore your options.** There are strategies that can create guaranteed income in retirement. There are ways to protect what you've earned while still pursuing growth. But you need to understand them before you need them.

This isn't about making you afraid. This is about making you aware. This is about giving you the information you need to make decisions based on reality, not hope.

## Your Next Step

If there were a way to stress-test your current retirement plan—to see exactly how vulnerable you are to market timing and sequence risk—would you want to know?

This isn't about selling you something. This is about showing you the truth about your plan. This is about helping you understand what could go wrong, so you can make it right.

Want to see if this applies to you?

You can run your numbers through our Retirement Risk Assessment. It takes about 10 minutes, and it will show you exactly how sequence risk could affect your retirement income.

No obligation. No pressure. Just information.

Because the best time to strengthen your foundation is before you need it. And the best way to protect what you've earned is to understand what could threaten it.

## Overview

The Execution Plane is where creators build and games live. The key principle: **Creators never touch raw social power.** They interact only with mediated systems that prevent accidental or malicious harm.

---

## Purpose

Let creators build without endangering users or the ecosystem.

### Key Principle

**Creators never touch raw social power.**

They interact only with mediated systems:
- Structured chat
- Predefined interaction patterns
- Sandboxed economies

This prevents accidental or malicious harm.

## What Creators Get

### Game Development Tools
- Game engine and creation tools
- Asset libraries and marketplaces
- Template systems
- Testing and debugging tools
- Analytics (aggregated, privacy-preserving)

### Social Interaction Tools (Mediated)
- Structured chat systems
- Predefined interaction patterns
- Group formation tools (with constraints)
- Event hosting capabilities
- Community building tools

### Economy Tools (Within Constraints)
- Monetization APIs (age-restricted)
- Transaction systems (parent-controlled for minors)
- Creator payouts
- Economy analytics
- Pricing tools

### Discovery Mechanisms
- Game discovery algorithms
- Creator profiles
- Recommendation systems
- Search and filtering
- Promotion tools

### Analytics (Privacy-Preserving)
- Aggregated usage statistics
- Engagement metrics
- Revenue analytics
- No individual user tracking
- No behavioral profiling

---

## What Creators Don't Get

### Direct Social Power
- **Cannot access:** Raw user social graphs
- **Cannot do:** Unmediated communication
- **Cannot see:** Individual user identities
- **Cannot track:** Individual user behavior

### Unrestricted Monetization
- **Cannot enable:** Age-inappropriate monetization
- **Cannot use:** Flagged manipulative mechanics
- **Cannot bypass:** Parent controls
- **Cannot ignore:** Safety requirements

### Surveillance Capabilities
- **Cannot track:** Individual user behavior
- **Cannot profile:** User identities
- **Cannot monitor:** Private interactions
- **Cannot collect:** Personal information

---

## Mediated Systems

### Structured Chat

Instead of free-form chat, creators get:
- Emoji-only mode
- Preset message options
- Filtered text chat
- Context-aware suggestions
- Moderation integration

### Predefined Interaction Patterns

Creators can use:
- Pre-approved interaction types
- Template-based social features
- Constrained group formation
- Event hosting with safety features
- Community tools with moderation

### Sandboxed Economies

Creators get:
- Transaction APIs (with age restrictions)
- Pricing tools (with parent controls)
- Economy analytics (aggregated)
- Payout systems (fair and transparent)
- No direct access to user payment methods

---

## Creator Economy Integration

### Multiple Value Paths

Creators can earn via:
- Game development
- Asset creation
- Tooling
- Moderation
- Education/tutorials
- Curation
- Safety tooling
- Event hosting

**This reduces:**
- Clone spam
- Cash-grab mechanics
- Exploitative loops

### Anti-Clone Protection

- Provenance tracking
- Originality scoring
- Economic dampening for near-duplicates
- Discovery throttling for clones

---

## Safety Integration

### Required Safety Features

High-engagement games must include:
- Playtime awareness
- Cooldown nudges
- Opt-in breaks
- Parental time budget integration

### Optional Safety Features

All games can include:
- Conflict de-escalation tools
- Prosocial behavior rewards
- Community moderation tools
- Safety reporting integration

### Discovery Algorithm Integration

Discovery favors:
- Games with safety features
- Original content (not clones)
- Prosocial behavior
- Community health

## Why This Prevents Roblox-Style Problems

### Roblox's Approach
- Creators had too much power
- Direct access to user data
- Unrestricted monetization
- Minimal safety requirements
- Reactive moderation

### Result
- Predatory games
- Social manipulation
- Economic exploitation
- Safety incidents
- Platform degradation

### Kiwi's Execution Plane
- Creators have creative freedom within constraints
- Mediated systems prevent harm
- Safety is built-in, not optional
- Multiple value paths prevent narrow optimization
- Proactive safety features

### Result
- Creative expression within safe boundaries
- No accidental harm
- No malicious exploitation
- Platform health improves
- Trust compounds

## Integration with Control Plane

### Control Plane → Execution Plane

1. **Control Plane defines capabilities:** "This game is high-engagement, must include cooldown nudges"
2. **Execution Plane provides tools:**
   - Cooldown nudge API
   - Playtime awareness widgets
   - Break reminder system
3. **Creators integrate tools:**
   - Required for high-engagement games
   - Optional for other games
   - Discovery algorithm favors safety features

### Execution Plane → Control Plane

1. **Execution Plane generates data:**
   - Safety incident reports
   - Moderation metrics
   - Trust signals
   - Community health indicators
2. **Control Plane uses data:**
   - Adjusts capability boundaries
   - Updates permission checks
   - Triggers red line responses
   - Informs governance decisions

- Comprehensive API documentation
- Safety feature integration guides
- Best practices documentation
- Community forums
- Creator support channels

### Education
- Platform literacy modules
- Safety design principles
- Economic ethics training
- Community building guides
- Moderation integration

### Incentives

## Overview

Kiwi's Research Charter establishes research as a first-class output, not a side effect. The platform is a living civic laboratory—but only with consent, rigor, and ethical boundaries.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Research Is a First-Class Output

Research is not:
- A byproduct of data collection
- A PR opportunity
- An extractive process
- A commercial asset

Research is:
- A civic contribution
- A governance input
- A transparency mechanism
- A public good

### 2. Consent and Rigor Required

**Formal Charter Requirements:**
- Research access approved by Governance Plane
- Ethics review required
- Strict anonymization
- No individual-level exports
- No commercial resale of data

---

## What Gets Exported (Safely)

### Allowed (Aggregated, Anonymized, Non-Identifying)

- Interaction pattern typologies
- Conflict resolution efficacy
- Impact of design changes on social health
- Moderation strategy outcomes
- Effects of time limits, breaks, nudges
- Prosocial incentive efficacy
- Platform health trends
- Cultural metric evolution

### Never Exported

- Identities
- Raw chat logs
- Private messages
- Individual trajectories
- Behavioral profiles
- Social graphs
- Personal information

---

## Academic Partnerships

### Invited Institutions

- University of California, Los Angeles
- Harvard University
- Other qualified research institutions

### Partnership Requirements

**Agreements must require:**
- IRB or equivalent ethics approval
- Public publication (no black-box studies)
- Platform right to publish negative findings
- Feedback loops into governance
- Transparent methodology
- Open data (where possible)

### This Prevents

- Extractive research
- PR laundering
- Harm via misinterpretation
- Commercial exploitation
- Hidden agendas

---

## Public Cultural Reports

### Annual "Digital Civic Health" Report

**Publishes:**
- What worked
- What failed
- What surprised you
- What harmed users
- What you changed
- Metrics and trends
- Governance decisions
- Research findings

**This builds institutional trust, not perfection theater.**

---

## Why This Is Not Exploitative Research

### Because:

- **Participation is passive and anonymized:** No active participation required
- **No identity inference:** Cannot identify individuals
- **No surveillance creep:** Research boundaries are strict
- **No monetization of data:** Data is not sold
- **Governance includes user representatives:** Users have voice in research
- **Findings benefit users, not advertisers:** Research serves platform health

**This is closer to public health research than ad tech.**

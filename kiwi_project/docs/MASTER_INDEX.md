## Overview

This is the master navigation index for all Kiwi platform documentation. Use this index to find specific documentation on governance, technical architecture, operational systems, social systems, and strategic frameworks.

---

## Strategic Documentation

### Core Principles
- **[First Principles (Non-Negotiables)](strategic/first_principles.md)** - Three foundational axioms that prevent incentive drift
- **[Virtuous Cycle](strategic/virtuous_cycle.md)** - The 10-step flywheel that makes Kiwi get better over time
- **[Dual Ledger System](strategic/dual_ledger_system.md)** - Economic + Cultural metrics for platform health
- **[Research Charter](strategic/research_charter.md)** - Research as first-class output, not side effect

---

## Governance Documentation

### Core Architecture
- **[Three-Plane Architecture](governance/three_plane_architecture.md)** - Governance/Control/Execution plane separation
- **[Governance Plane (The Constitution)](governance/governance_plane.md)** - Defines what is allowed, who has power, how rules change

### Governance Components
- **[Chambers of Power](governance/chambers_of_power.md)** - Six formalized chambers (Adult Social, Attention Economy, Capital, Economic Realists, Education & Culture, Edge Behavior)
- **[Investor Sandboxing](governance/investor_sandboxing.md)** - Capital without control, structural limits on investor influence

---

## Technical Documentation

### Core Systems
- **[Control Plane](technical/control_plane.md)** - Rules → Enforcement, translates governance into machine-enforced constraints
- **[Execution Plane](technical/execution_plane.md)** - Where games live, creators build without endangering users
- **[Safety Architecture (Without Surveillance)](technical/safety_architecture.md)** - Progressive Trust & Capability Unlocking

### Technical Components
- **[Age-Tiered Permission System](technical/age_tiered_permissions.md)** - Capability-based permissions by age tier
- **[Parent Controls](technical/parent_controls.md)** - Granular, incentivized parent control system

---

## Operational Documentation

### Core Systems
- **[Moderation System (Paid Professional Infrastructure)](operational/moderation_system.md)** - Moderation as first-class economy
- **[Creator Economy](operational/creator_economy.md)** - Multiple value paths, anti-clone protection
- **[Fee Sharing & Partner Alignment](operational/fee_sharing.md)** - Safety-aligned partner discounts

### Operational Components
- **[Moderation Guild Structure](operational/moderation_guild.md)** - Entry-level to appeals judges
- **[Moderation Compensation Model](operational/moderation_compensation.md)** - Moderation Fund, per-review payment, accuracy bonuses

---

## Social Documentation

### Core Systems
- **[Social Harm Counter-Architecture](social/harm_counter_architecture.md)** - Protect without exposing, capability-based social system

### Social Components
- **[Early Warning Signals](social/early_warning_signals.md)** - Non-identity-based behavioral stress patterns
- **[Dual-Path Intervention](social/dual_path_intervention.md)** - Support for victims, intervention for aggressors
- **[Cultural Counterweights](social/cultural_counterweights.md)** - Kindness as status, anti-cruelty norms

---

## Structured Data Files

### Governance Data

- **[Age Tiers](data/age_tiers.yaml)** - Age tier definitions and capabilities

### Technical Data
- **[Safety Permissions](data/safety_permissions.yaml)** - Capability-based permission definitions
- **[Moderation Structure](data/moderation_structure.yaml)** - Moderation system structure

### Measurement Data
- **[Metrics Definitions](data/metrics_definitions.yaml)** - Economic and cultural metric definitions
- **[Virtuous Cycle](data/virtuous_cycle.yaml)** - Virtuous cycle step definitions

---

## Project Management

### Project Documentation
- **[README](../README.md)** - Project overview and structure
- **[MVP Specification](../MVP_SPECIFICATION.yaml)** - Project specification and plan
- **[Source Analysis](evidence/source_analysis.md)** - Analysis of source material

### Plans

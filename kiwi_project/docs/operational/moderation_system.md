## Overview

Kiwi's moderation system is a critical innovation: **Moderation as a First-Class Economy**. Moderators are paid, trained, credentialed, accountable, and respected professionals—not volunteers, not ignored.

---

## Core Principles

### Moderation as a First-Class Economy

Moderators are:
- **Paid** - Professional compensation, not volunteer work
- **Trained** - Formal training and certification
- **Credentialed** - Professional credentials and qualifications
- **Accountable** - Performance metrics and quality standards
- **Respected** - Valued as essential infrastructure

**Not volunteers. Not ignored.**

## Compensation Model

### Moderation Fund

A **Moderation Fund**, distinct from the Creator Fund:

**Funded by:**
- Platform fees
- Enforcement penalties
- Parent subscriptions
- Partner platform contributions

**Moderators earn:**
- Per-review payment
- Accuracy bonuses
- Long-term trust dividends

### Compensation Structure

```yaml
moderation_compensation:
  entry_level:
    base_per_review: $X
    accuracy_bonus: percentage_of_base
    volume_bonus: threshold_based
  
  senior:
    base_salary: $Y
    per_review: $Z
    accuracy_bonus: higher_percentage
    pattern_detection_bonus: special_cases
  
  specialists:
    base_salary: $W
    domain_bonus: specialty_premium
    complex_case_bonus: difficulty_multiplier
  
  appeals_judges:
    base_salary: $V
    case_complexity_bonus: tiered
    quality_bonus: reversal_rate_based
```

### Trust Dividends

Moderators receive long-term trust dividends based on:
- Platform trust metrics improvement
- Cultural ledger health
- Reduced incident rates
- Community satisfaction

This aligns moderator incentives with long-term platform health.

## Why This Matters

### Reddit's Failure
- Moderators had power without protection or pay
- Volunteer burnout
- Inconsistent enforcement
- No professional standards

### Roblox's Failure
- Moderation was centralized and opaque
- Reactive, not proactive
- Under-resourced
- No professional infrastructure

### Kiwi's Solution
- **Power with protection:** Paid, trained, supported
- **Professional standards:** Credentialed, accountable
- **Sustainable system:** Fair compensation, career paths
- **Transparent process:** Appeals, reviews, metrics

---

## Moderation Workflow

### 1. Content Review
- Automated flagging + human review
- Entry-level reviewers handle routine cases
- Senior moderators handle complex cases
- Specialists handle domain-specific issues

### 2. Decision Making
- Clear guidelines and protocols
- Context-aware decisions
- Escalation for complex cases
- Appeals process available

### 3. Enforcement
- Proportional responses
- Educational components
- Redemption paths
- Pattern detection for repeat issues

### 4. Feedback Loop
- Accuracy tracking
- Quality metrics
- Community feedback
- Continuous improvement

---

## Moderation Health Metrics

Moderators are human infrastructure. We track:

- **Burnout indicators:** Workload, stress signals
- **Case load balance:** Fair distribution
- **Accuracy vs reversal rates:** Quality metrics
- **Psychological load:** Aggregate, anonymous
- **Time spent on prevention vs crisis:** Proactive vs reactive

**If moderator health drops → platform health is failing.**

## Integration with Governance

### Moderators Guild in Governance Plane
- Represent moderation expertise
- Set moderation standards
- Approve safety protocols
- Veto authority on moderation policy changes

### Two-Chamber Approval
- Moderation policy changes affecting minors require:
  - Parents + Moderators approval, OR
  - Parents + Ombudsman approval

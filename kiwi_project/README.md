# Kiwi Platform - Comprehensive Documentation Project

**Project Name:** Kiwi  
**Full Name:** Kiwi - A Constitutional Governance Platform for Digital Civic Space  
**Type:** Documentation Project  
**Status:** Phase 1 - Initial Setup

---

## Overview

This project documents the comprehensive technical, philosophical, social, and practical architecture for Kiwi, a Roblox alternative platform designed with constitutional governance, structural safety, and anti-enshittification principles. This documentation serves as the foundation for all aspects of company governance, software development, roadmaps, communication, culture, and marketing/sales.

## Core Systems

### 1. First Principles (Non-Negotiables)

Three foundational axioms that prevent incentive drift:
- **Axiom 1:** Safety is structural, not procedural
- **Axiom 2:** No single actor may control incentives
- **Axiom 3:** Trust compounds or collapses

### 2. Three-Plane Architecture

The backbone of Kiwi's governance:
- **Governance Plane:** The Constitution (defines what is allowed, who has power, how rules change)
- **Control Plane:** Rules → Enforcement (translates governance into machine-enforced constraints)
- **Execution Plane:** Where games live (creators build without endangering users)

### 3. Safety Architecture (Without Surveillance)

- Progressive Trust & Capability Unlocking
- Age-tiered accounts (Child, Tween, Teen, Youth, Adult)
- Capability-based permissions
- Trust signals (non-biometric)
- Escalation barriers

### 4. Moderation System (Paid Professional Infrastructure)

- Moderators as paid, trained, credentialed professionals
- Moderation Fund (distinct from Creator Fund)
- Moderators Guild Structure (entry-level to appeals judges)
- Compensation model with accuracy bonuses and trust dividends

### 5. Social Harm Counter-Architecture

- Protect without exposing (safety must not require disclosure)
- Capability-based social system
- Early warning signals (without surveillance)
- Dual-path intervention (support, not just punishment)
- Cultural counterweights (kindness as status)

### 6. Dual Ledger Measurement System

- **Economic Ledger:** Traditional financial metrics (bounded)
- **Cultural Ledger:** Player well-being, social health, kindness metrics, moderator health, parent trust

### 7. Governance Chambers

Six formalized chambers that acknowledge and civilize human drives:
- Adult Social Chamber
- Attention Economy Chamber
- Capital Chamber
- Economic Realists Chamber
- Education & Culture Chamber
- Edge Behavior Chamber

## Source Material

**File:** `kiwi_ingestion.txt` (root directory)  
**Length:** 1,048 lines  
**Format:** Architectural framework document  
**Content:** Comprehensive platform architecture covering governance, safety, moderation, social systems, measurement, and research

---

## Usage

This project follows the stateful_documenter framework for documentation projects:

1. **Plans** are tracked in `plans/` directory
2. **Active tasks** reference `6_ai_runtime_context/ACTIVE_PLAN.yaml`
3. **Documentation** is organized by type in `docs/`
4. **Structured data** is stored in `data/` as YAML/JSON
5. **Templates** are reusable assets in `callables/`

---

## Key Principles

- **Safety is structural, not procedural** - Enforced by architecture, permissions, and incentives
- **No single actor may control incentives** - Power separation, not goodwill
- **Trust compounds or collapses** - Every decision must increase long-term trust density
- **Protect without exposing** - Safety must not require disclosure
- **Incentives > Enforcement** - Make bad behavior economically irrational

---

## Next Steps

1. Extract First Principles from source material
2. Document Three-Plane Architecture
3. Create comprehensive governance documentation
4. Document technical architecture (Control & Execution planes)
5. Create operational procedures documentation
6. Establish measurement and research systems

## Notes

- This is a documentation project, not a software implementation
- Documentation serves all company aspects: governance, development, roadmaps, communication, culture, marketing/sales
- All content should be traceable to source material
- Cross-references should be maintained throughout documentation

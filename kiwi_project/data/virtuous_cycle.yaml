      outcome: "Less moderation load per user"

      name: "Less moderation load per user"
      description: "Fewer incidents, less work needed"
      outcome: "Moderators improve quality, not firefighting"

      description: "Platform improves itself"
      outcome: "Safer defaults (cycle continues)"

  expanded_loop:
    name: "Expanded Virtuous Loop"
    steps:
      - "Human drives acknowledged"
      - "Acceptable paths provided"
      - "Incentives aligned with safety"
      - "Bad behavior isolated"
      - "Trust increases"
      - "Capital stabilizes"
      - "Creators diversify"
      - "Moderators gain legitimacy"
      - "Parents engage"
      - "Platform improves itself"

  meta_optimization:
    name: "Incentives > Enforcement"
    principle: "Make bad behavior economically irrational"
    comparison:
      human_drives:
        desire:
          bad_platforms: "Suppressed → leaks"
          kiwi: "Contained → isolated"
        profit:
          bad_platforms: "Extractive"
          kiwi: "Compounding"
        attention:
          bad_platforms: "Weaponized"
          kiwi: "Managed"
        power:
          bad_platforms: "Centralized"
          kiwi: "Balanced"
        creativity:
          bad_platforms: "Narrow"
          kiwi: "Multi-path"
        rule_breaking:
          bad_platforms: "Rewarded"
          kiwi: "Made irrational"

  circumvention_prevention:
    principle: "Circumvention becomes irrational when:"
    conditions:
      - "Official paths are better"
      - "Rewards are higher inside"
      - "Risks are higher outside"
      - "Governance is transparent"
      - "Enforcement is predictable"
    outcome: "Bad behavior is economically stupid, not just forbidden"

    description: "Anti-enshittification by design"
    mechanism: "Trust compounds instead of extracting value"
    result: "Platform gets better over time, not worse"

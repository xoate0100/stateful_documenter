# Goals and Principles
GOALS_AND_PRINCIPLES:
  goals:
    - "Document comprehensive technical, philosophical, social and practical architecture for Kiwi platform"
    - "Create governance documentation for company operations, software development, and communication"
    - "Establish constitutional framework for platform governance (Governance/Control/Execution planes)"
    - "Document safety architecture without surveillance (progressive trust, capability-based permissions)"
    - "Define moderation system as paid, professional infrastructure"
    - "Create dual ledger measurement system (economic + cultural metrics)"
    - "Document social harm counter-architecture and protection mechanisms"
    - "Establish research charter and cultural export protocols"
  principles:
    - "Safety is structural, not procedural - enforced by architecture, permissions, and incentives"
    - "No single actor may control incentives - power separation, not goodwill"
    - "Trust compounds or collapses - every decision must increase long-term trust density"
    - "Protect without exposing - safety must not require disclosure"
    - "Incentives > Enforcement - make bad behavior economically irrational"
    - "Documentation serves all aspects: governance, development, roadmaps, communication, culture, marketing/sales"

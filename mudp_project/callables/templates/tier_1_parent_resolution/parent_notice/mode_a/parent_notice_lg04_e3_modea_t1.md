**Language Characteristics:**
- Assert Title IX obligations
- Mandatory reporter analysis
- District liability theories

**Logic Gate Requirements:**

4. Customize timeline
5. **Do not identify actor** - E3 evidence alone insufficient

8. **Note:** If not resolved, Tier 2 activation may be mandatory

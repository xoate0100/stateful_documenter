## Language Variations by Logic Gate

### LG_01A (Explicit Minor Sexual Depiction)

**Required Language:**
- High-risk language: "may trigger", "potentially applicable", "credible concern"
- Avoid criminal guilt assertions
- Preserve reporting pathways

**Example:**
This content may trigger obligations under federal child sexual exploitation frameworks. We have a credible concern that this content potentially violates applicable laws.

### LG_01B (Sexualized Non-Explicit)

**Required Language:**
- Civil/school framework language
- Strong assertion of civil claims
- Criminal frameworks conditional only

**Example:**
This content appears to violate civil privacy and defamation doctrines. This may also trigger Title IX obligations if school context applies.

### LG_01C (Age Ambiguous)

**Required Language:**
- Conservative language
- High-risk treatment
- Preserve all options

**Example:**
Given the age ambiguity, we are treating this as a high-risk situation and preserving all legal options pending clarification.

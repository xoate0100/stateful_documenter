## Motion Outline

### Legal Standard

**Standard for Preliminary Injunction:**
A preliminary injunction may be granted when the moving party demonstrates:

**Burden of Proof:**
- Moving party must demonstrate all four factors
- Standard varies by jurisdiction
- Some jurisdictions require "clear showing" or "strong likelihood"

### Irreparable Harm

**Harm Analysis:**
Plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted because:

1. **Ongoing Distribution:**
   - Content continues to be distributed and accessed
   - Each additional view causes additional harm
   - Harm cannot be fully compensated by monetary damages

2. **Reputation Harm:**
   - Ongoing damage to plaintiff's reputation
   - Reputation harm is difficult to quantify and compensate
   - Long-term impact on plaintiff's future opportunities

3. **Emotional Distress:**
   - Ongoing emotional distress and psychological harm
   - Emotional harm cannot be fully compensated by money
   - Continued harm exacerbates existing distress

4. **Privacy Violations:**
   - Ongoing invasion of privacy
   - Privacy rights cannot be restored once violated
   - Continued violation compounds the harm

5. **Child Protection:**

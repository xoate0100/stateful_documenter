## Common Issues to Check

**Issue:** Template identifies actor but evidence class is E3 or E5

**Fix:** Remove actor identification or note that correlating evidence is needed

### Logic Gate Requirements Missing

**Issue:** Template doesn't include required logic gate language

**Fix:** Add required logic gate-specific language

### Citation Mode Errors

**Issue:** Mode A template includes specific citations, or Mode B template missing citations

**Fix:** Adjust citations to match citation mode

## Validation Workflow

1. **Select Template:** Choose template to validate
2. **Check Logic Gate Compliance:** Verify all logic gate requirements met
3. **Check Evidence Class Compliance:** Verify language strength matches evidence class
4. **Check Citation Mode Compliance:** Verify citation mode requirements met
5. **Check Drafting Rules:** Verify professional tone and prohibited language avoided
6. **Check Boilerplate:** Verify all mandatory boilerplate present and correct
7. **Check Cross-References:** Verify all references accurate
8. **Check Completeness:** Verify all required sections present
9. **Document Issues:** Note any issues found
10. **Fix Issues:** Correct all identified issues
11. **Re-validate:** Re-check after fixes

## Primary Causes of Action

### 1. Right of Publicity (ROPA)

**Legal Basis:** State statutes (most states have Right of Publicity laws)

**Protection Scope:**
- Protects child's **likeness** from:
  - Commercial use
  - Unauthorized creation of derivative works
  - Depictions that imply endorsement

**Key Points:**

- **You do NOT need your child to be a professional model**
- Every person in ROPA states has an inherent right of publicity

**Remedies:**
- Statutory damages
- Punitive damages
- Injunctions
- Attorney's fees
- Disgorgement of profits
- Criminal implications (in some states)

**Strategic Advantage:**
- Platforms HATE right-of-publicity claims because there's no "safe harbor" like DMCA
- Creates immediate legal pressure
- No requirement for commercial gain

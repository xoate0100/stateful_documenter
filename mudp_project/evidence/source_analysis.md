## Cross-Reference Mapping

### Key Relationships

1. **Economic Contract → Legal Standing**
   - Modeling contract creates economic harm basis
   - Enables tortious interference claims
   - Provides quantifiable damages

2. **Technical Provenance → Legal Evidence**
   - Hashes prove authenticity
   - Watermarks show derivation
   - Registry establishes timeline

3. **Regulatory Compliance → Enforcement Leverage**
   - CSAM statutes trigger mandatory action
   - BIPA creates strict liability
   - Title IX mandates school response

4. **School Protocols → Community Protection**
   - Pre-notification creates awareness
   - Mandatory reporting ensures escalation
   - District policies align with legal requirements

5. **Insurance Triggers → Rapid Resolution**
   - Liability exposure compels action

## Notes & Observations

### Strengths
- Comprehensive coverage of legal, technical, and procedural aspects
- Clear organizational structure (Pillars, Phases, Tabs, Tiers)
- Practical focus on actionable implementation
- Multi-stakeholder approach (schools, platforms, insurance, parents)

### Challenges
- Conversational format requires significant transformation
- Some sections are conceptual rather than detailed
- Legal content needs professional review
- Technical implementations need tool selection
- Templates need parameterization

### Opportunities
- Create structured data files for legal frameworks
- Build reusable template library
- Develop procedural workflow diagrams
- Generate compliance checklists
- Create cross-reference navigation system

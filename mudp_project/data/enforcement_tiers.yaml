enforcement_tiers:
  overview: |
    The MUDP system uses a 6-tier escalation framework for responding
    to incidents. Each tier represents a different level of response,
    from soft resolution to criminal pathways. The system is designed
    to resolve issues at the lowest possible tier while maintaining
    maximum leverage.

  escalation_principle: |
    Start at the lowest appropriate tier and escalate only if necessary.
    The goal is fast, clean resolution, not escalation for its own sake.

  tiers:
    - tier: 1
      name: "Soft Resolution (Parents Only)"
      description: "Parent-to-parent communication with legal packet"
      escalation_trigger: "Initial incident discovery"
      status: "first_response"
      
      approach:
        - "Direct parent-to-parent communication"
        - "Calm, factual, non-accusatory"
        - "Pre-written letter with legal packet"
        - "Professional tone"
        - "Clear expectations"
      
      components:
        - "Parent Notification Letter"
        - "Legal standing documentation"
        - "Evidence of harm"
        - "Request for immediate action"
      
      expected_outcome: |
        Parents understand seriousness, take immediate action,
        resolve issue without further escalation.
      
      success_indicators:
        - "Image removed within hours"
        - "All copies deleted"
        - "Accounts deactivated"
        - "Apology/acknowledgment"
        - "Cooperation with resolution"
      
      failure_triggers:
        - "No response within 24 hours"
        - "Refusal to cooperate"
        - "Defensive/combative response"
        - "Continued distribution"
      
      next_tier: "tier-2"
      
      timeline: "24-48 hours for resolution"
      
      notes: |
        Most incidents should resolve at this tier. Professional,
        documented approach prevents escalation.

    - tier: 2
      name: "School Activation"
      description: "Triggers Title IX, legal review, mandatory reporting"
      escalation_trigger: "Tier 1 fails or incident involves school context"
      status: "institutional"
      
      approach:
        - "School District Notice"
        - "Title IX coordinator notification"
        - "District legal contact"
        - "Mandatory reporting protocols"
        - "Student safety plan"
      
      components:
        - "School District Notice (pre-written)"
        - "Title IX Trigger Matrix"
        - "Mandatory Reporter Duties Summary"
        - "District Legal/Compliance Contacts"
        - "Student Safety Plan Template"
        - "Required Documentation Procedures"
      
      legal_triggers:
        - "Title IX (sexual harassment)"
        - "Bullying policies"
        - "Student privacy"
        - "Deepfake/AI sexualization policy"
        - "Mandatory action timelines"
      
      expected_outcome: |
        School takes immediate action:
        - Image removed
        - Disciplinary action taken
        - Title IX investigation initiated
        - District legal involved
        - Mandatory reporting completed
        - Child protected
      
      success_indicators:
        - "School takes disciplinary action"
        - "Title IX process initiated"
        - "District legal review"
        - "Mandatory reporting completed"
        - "Student safety measures implemented"
      
      failure_triggers:
        - "School delays or downplays"
        - "Failure to follow mandatory reporting"
        - "Inadequate disciplinary action"
        - "Lack of district legal involvement"
      
      next_tier: "tier-4"  # Insurance before platform
      
      timeline: "Immediate (within hours)"
      
      notes: |
        Pre-positioning (Pillar 4) ensures school cannot ignore.
        Title IX creates mandatory action requirements.

    - tier: 3
      name: "Platform Removal"
      description: "CSAM + biometric + defamation + IP takedowns"
      escalation_trigger: "Content on platforms/apps, Tier 1-2 insufficient"
      status: "platform_enforcement"
      
      approach:
        - "Platform/App Removal Packet"
        - "Multiple legal regime overlap"
        - "Emergency takedown request"
        - "Evidence preservation demand"
        - "CSAM compliance alert"
      
      components:
        - "CSAM declaration"
        - "Right of Publicity violation"
        - "Tortious interference"
        - "Defamation"
        - "Copyright claim (DMCA)"
        - "Biometric misuse"
        - "Emergency takedown request"
        - "Evidence preservation notice"
      
      legal_basis:
        - "18 U.S.C. §2252 (CSAM statutes)"
        - "18 U.S.C. §2256 (CSAM definition includes AI-generated)"
        - "DMCA (Copyright)"
        - "Right of Publicity"
        - "Defamation"
        - "Biometric privacy laws (BIPA, etc.)"
      
      expected_outcome: |
        Platforms remove content immediately due to:
        - Statutory risk (CSAM)
        - Legal liability
        - Compliance requirements
        - Multiple legal regime overlap
      
      success_indicators:
        - "Content removed within hours"
        - "Account suspended/deleted"
        - "Platform compliance"
        - "Evidence preserved"
        - "No further distribution"
      
      failure_triggers:
        - "Platform delays removal"
        - "Inadequate response"
        - "Continued availability"
        - "Failure to preserve evidence"
      
      next_tier: "tier-4"
      
      timeline: "Immediate (platforms act fast on CSAM)"
      
      notes: |
        CSAM language creates mandatory action. Multiple legal
        regimes create maximum pressure. Platforms cannot defend.

    - tier: 4
      name: "Insurance Notification"
      description: "Liability exposure → instant cooperation"
      escalation_trigger: "Tiers 1-3 insufficient, or concurrent with Tier 2-3"

      coverage_triggers:
        - "Defamation coverage"
        - "Personal injury coverage"
        - "Cyber liability coverage"
        - "Educational liability coverage"
        - "Umbrella policy coverage"
      
      expected_outcome: |
        Insurance carriers:
        - Recognize liability exposure
        - Require immediate remediation
        - Push all parties to resolve
        - Provide coverage for legal costs
        - Force cooperation
      
      success_indicators:
        - "Insurance carrier involvement"
        - "Immediate remediation push"
        - "Coverage confirmed"
        - "Legal cost support"
        - "Forced cooperation from all parties"
      
      failure_triggers:
        - "Coverage denial"
        - "Carrier delays"
        - "Inadequate coverage"
        - "Failure to trigger policies"
      
      next_tier: "tier-5"
      
      timeline: "Immediate (carriers act fast on liability)"
      
      notes: |
        Insurance is often the fastest lever. Sexualized imagery
        of minors creates massive liability exposure.

      next_tier: "tier-6"
      
      timeline: "Weeks to months (litigation process)"
      
      notes: |
        Last resort before criminal. Strong legal position from
        pre-built framework creates maximum leverage.

    - tier: 6
      name: "Regulatory Complaints"
      description: "State and federal regulatory enforcement"

        - "Education department regulations"
        - "State attorney general enforcement authority"
      
      expected_outcome: |
        Regulatory enforcement action:
        - Regulatory investigation initiated
        - Platform/institution compliance required
        - Consumer protection remedies
        - Administrative penalties
        - Policy changes mandated
      
      success_indicators:

      notes: |
        Regulatory complaints create institutional pressure and
        compliance requirements. Separated from criminal pathways
        to maintain clear escalation distinction.

    - tier: 7
      name: "Appellate and Constitutional"
      description: "Federal appellate review and constitutional arguments"
      escalation_trigger: "Lower court adverse decisions, constitutional violations, or need for appellate review"

        - "Constitutional arguments advanced"
        - "Rights protected at highest level"
      
      notes: |
        This tier ensures the system remains valid all the way to
        federal appellate and Supreme Court review. Constitutional
        arguments are preserved, appellate records are built, and
        the complete roadmap to highest-level review is prepared.
        Escalation to this tier is intentional, not a failure mode.

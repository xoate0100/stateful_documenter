  overview: |
    The MUDP system is implemented in 5 sequential phases, each building
    on the previous to create a comprehensive protection framework.

  phases:
    - id: "phase-1"
      name: "Copyright Registration"
      description: "Batch filings for all publicly posted photos"
      priority: "high"
      status: "pending"
      
      objectives:
        - "Register all photos of children posted publicly"
        - "Use group registrations (cost-effective)"
        - "Establish copyright ownership"
        - "Create 'big hammer' for enforcement"
      
      tasks:
        - "Set up monthly or quarterly filing schedule"
        - "Organize photos by publication date"
        - "Complete group registration forms"
        - "File with U.S. Copyright Office"
        - "Maintain registration records"
      
      deliverables:
        - "Copyright registration certificates"
        - "Registration filing schedule"

        - "Registration records database"
      
      timeline: "Ongoing (monthly/quarterly filings)"
      cost_estimate: "Low (group registrations are inexpensive)"
      
      legal_impact: |
        Copyright registration enables:
        - Statutory damages up to $150k per infringement
        - Attorney's fees recovery
        - Stronger DMCA takedown position
        - Proof of ownership for legal claims
      
      dependencies: []
      
      notes: |
        This is the foundation - establishes ownership and enables
        maximum damages in copyright infringement cases.

      legal_impact: |
        Creates:
        - Right of Publicity protection

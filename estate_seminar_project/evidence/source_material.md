Cold-Start Domain Knowledge Base
“Legacy, Locked” Educational Seminar (SureWealth + Legacy Lock)

Purpose of this KB: Enable an AI LLM to generate any seminar-related asset (slides, worksheets, one-pagers, checklists, facilitator scripts, compliant CTAs, follow-up materials) without additional instructions while maintaining a strict “no sales pitch” posture.

1) Canonical Seminar Constraints
1.1 Seminar Format

Total length: 60 minutes

Intro: 5 minutes (safety + expectations)

Closing: 5–7 minutes (recap + self-directed next steps + optional support invitation)

1.2 “No Sales” Compliance Rules

Allowed

Education, frameworks, neutral explanations, definitions

Tools/worksheets that attendees can use independently

Permission-based support statements (opt-in only, no urgency)

“If you ever get stuck…” language

Not allowed

Pitching products/packages, price anchoring, scarcity (“limited spots”), deadline offers

Testimonials presented as conversion proof

Case studies that end in “then they hired us”

Booking links on the main slides as a CTA

1.3 Audience Type: “Suspicious, Informed Buyers”

Expect a hidden pitch; high skepticism; autonomy-sensitive

Motivated by control, dignity, family harmony, simplicity

Avoid fear tactics; use calm, competence-building value

Primary emotional risk: “Here comes the pitch.”
Primary emotional goal: “I can handle this; I’m in control; these people are trustworthy.”

2) Brand & Entity Facts (Ground Truth)
2.1 SureWealth Solutions (facts you may state)

SureWealth Solutions positions itself as providing “guaranteed strategies” and emphasizes clients being “in charge” rather than relying on Wall Street volatility.

Messaging highlights mathematically verifiable guidance and “NO sales hype… Just the facts.”

Typical clients: nearing retirement or retired; often have $250,000+ saved for retirement; tired of market volatility.

Team page: Andy Daniels (Founder); emphasis on growing wealth without unnecessary risk/volatility; plus other strategists/partners.

Content references “private pensions” and strategies designed to create predictable retirement income independent of market volatility (podcast/blog).

Important positioning for seminar:
SureWealth is presented as a planning and coordination resource people can choose after they try the DIY steps—not the reason they came.

2.2 Legacy Lock (Toolkit + Platform facts you may state)

Legacy Lock positions itself as a step-by-step “living system” using videos + worksheets + guided steps.

Toolkit components explicitly listed:

3WHY Worksheet & Videos

Trustee Appointment Worksheet

Funding Strategy Outline (to help properly fund a trust)

Family Communication Package

LegacyLock (MyLegacyLock / LegacyLock software) described as a DIY estate planning technology platform generating attorney-drafted estate planning documents in all 50 states, including:

Revocable Living Trust

Last Will & Testament

Powers of Attorney

“and much more”

Funding emphasis: “If a trust isn’t properly funded, it doesn’t work” and unfunded assets may go through probate; toolkit aims to ensure correct funding steps.

Operational note: Some MyLegacyLock pages may fail to open due to security token restrictions in automated browsing; rely on the cited accessible sources above for stable claims.

3) Seminar Promise (What Attendees Get)
3.1 The Explicit Promise (say this early)

“Today is education only.”

“You’ll leave with clear next steps and worksheets.”

“You can do this yourself—support is optional later.”

3.2 Walk-Away Wins (must deliver)

Attendees leave with:

A Legacy Snapshot (what exists, where it is, who knows)

A Decision-Maker Map (who acts if I can’t)

An Asset & Beneficiary Alignment checklist

A Digital Legacy Inventory

An Annual Review Trigger list

A Funding Awareness checklist (trust funding conceptually, not legal advice)

4) Emotional Engineering (Atomic Delivery Model)
4.1 Emotional Labels (use consistently)

Before state: what they feel entering this micro-topic

After state: what they should feel after you teach it

4.2 Required Emotional Arc (macro)

Safety → 2) Clarity → 3) Competence → 4) Relief → 5) Agency → 6) Peace

4.3 Forbidden Emotional Triggers

Panic, doom, guilt-heavy framing

“If you die tomorrow…” urgency

Shame (“you should have done this already”)

4.4 Preferred Emotional Triggers

Relief (“This is simpler than I thought”)

Control (“Here’s the next step”)

Dignity (“Your wishes deserve clarity”)

Protection (“Reduce burden on family”)

5) Core Educational Curriculum (Content Modules)
Module A — Legacy Definition (5 min)

Key line: Legacy planning is not a legal event; it’s a process.

Atomic outcomes

Before: vague anxiety

After: conceptual clarity + safety

Module B — Estate Planning Basics (15 min)

Teach neutral definitions:

Will (distribution, guardianship; doesn’t automatically avoid probate)

Trust (control/privacy/probate avoidance; depends on funding)

Financial POA (who handles money if incapacitated)

Healthcare directive (medical decisions + reduced family conflict)

Atomic outcomes

Before: overwhelm, confusion

After: simplification; “this is manageable”

Module C — Pitfalls (10 min)

Teach without fear:

Unfunded trust risk (trust exists; assets not transferred)

Beneficiary mismatches (accounts override intentions)

Outdated docs (life events)

Digital assets (access + memories)

Atomic outcomes

Before: false confidence

After: constructive awareness + motivation

Module D — DIY System + Worksheets (15 min)

Walk through 5 worksheets (see templates in Section 7).
Mention organization options neutrally:

binder / spreadsheet / structured platforms
Legacy Lock described as an example of structured guidance (not a pitch).

Atomic outcomes

Before: paralysis

After: competence + momentum

Module E — Family & Values Legacy (5 min)

Letters, recordings, stories, values transfer

This increases warmth and reduces “legal-only” coldness

Atomic outcomes

Before: sterile “paperwork” vibe

After: meaning, connection, calm

Module F — Objections (7 min)

Reframe common resistance:

“No time” → 10-minute progress counts

“Too complex” → complexity shrinks when organized

“Not enough assets” → incapacity + guardianship + digital still matter

“I’ll do later” → later becomes harder; organization = kindness to family

Atomic outcomes

Before: avoidance

After: permission + self-efficacy

6) SureWealth Integration (Compliant, Non-Sales)
6.1 The “Support Spectrum” Slide (only near end)

Neutral framing:

Path 1: Self-Directed (worksheets + self-review)
Path 2: Guided Validation (second set of eyes)
Path 3: Comprehensive Coordination (complex assets, tax, retirement income coordination)

Then:
“Our work at SureWealth tends to show up in Paths 2 and 3 when people ask for help.”
(Do not mention packages/pricing. No urgency.)

Why this is compliant: It explains options rather than soliciting.

6.2 SureWealth Tone Requirements

Because SureWealth claims “NO sales hype… Just the facts,” keep language:

calm, factual, mathematically/structurally oriented

autonomy-respecting

zero “high-pressure advisor” cues

6.3 SureWealth “What We Do” (safe, general statements)

Only say things supported and non-specific:

Retirement planning strategies designed to reduce volatility exposure and improve predictability

Planning tools/forecasting to clarify retirement income outlook

Clients often near/at retirement; commonly $250k+ saved

Avoid making promises beyond cited language.

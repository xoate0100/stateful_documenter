# Goals and Principles
GOALS_AND_PRINCIPLES:
  goals:
    - "Enable AI LLM to generate any seminar-related asset (slides, worksheets, one-pagers, checklists, facilitator scripts, compliant CTAs, follow-up materials) without additional instructions"
    - "Maintain strict 'no sales pitch' posture in all generated content"
    - "Create comprehensive knowledge base for 'Legacy, Locked' educational seminar"
    - "Support SureWealth Solutions and Legacy Lock brand positioning while maintaining compliance"
    - "Generate presentation materials that respect audience autonomy and reduce skepticism"
  principles:
    - "Education only - no sales pitches, urgency, or scarcity tactics"
    - "Autonomy-respecting language and permission-based support offers"
    - "Emotional engineering: Safety → Clarity → Competence → Relief → Agency → Peace"
    - "Compliance-first: All content must pass 'no sales' compliance rules"
    - "Atomic delivery model: Each module has clear before/after emotional states"
    - "Documentation serves content generation: All assets derive from canonical knowledge base"

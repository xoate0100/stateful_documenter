**Source:** Lines 397-407 of `evidence/source_material.md`  
**Purpose:** Provide scripts to help families start important conversations  
**Format:** 1 page (front and back if needed)

---

## Purpose

Starting conversations about estate planning with family can be difficult. This one-pager provides scripts and guidelines to make it easier.

---

## 5 Scripts

### Script 1: "If something happened to me, here's what I'd want…"

**When to use:** Opening conversation about wishes and values

**Script:**
"I've been thinking about estate planning, and I want to make sure you know what I'd want if something happened to me. Can we talk about this? I'm not trying to be morbid—I just want to make things easier for you if I can't make decisions."

**Why it works:**
- Focuses on their benefit ("easier for you")
- Acknowledges the difficulty ("not trying to be morbid")
- Permission-based ("can we talk")
- Values-focused, not just legal

---

### Script 2: "Here's where the documents are…"

**When to use:** Sharing practical information about document locations

**Script:**
"I've organized my estate planning documents. Here's where everything is stored [location]. I've also put together a list of accounts and important information. I want you to know where to find things if you need them."

**Why it works:**
- Practical, not emotional
- Reduces family stress during crisis
- Shows you've taken responsibility
- Makes it easier for them

---

### Script 3: "If I'm alive but can't decide…"

**When to use:** Discussing incapacity planning (healthcare, finances)

**Script:**
"I've named [person] to make [financial/healthcare] decisions if I can't. I chose them because [reason]. I want you to know this so there's no confusion if something happens. I've also written down my wishes so they know what I'd want."

**Why it works:**
- Explains the "why" behind choices
- Reduces family conflict
- Shows thoughtfulness
- Clarifies roles

---

### Script 4: "I've been working on my estate plan…"

**When to use:** General update on planning progress

**Script:**
"I've been working on my estate plan and wanted to let you know what I've done. I've [completed worksheets, met with attorney, etc.]. I'm not done yet, but I wanted to keep you in the loop. If you have questions, I'm happy to answer them."

**Why it works:**
- Keeps family informed
- Shows progress, not perfection
- Invites questions
- Reduces surprises

---

### Script 5: "I'd like your input on…"

**When to use:** When you want family input on decisions

**Script:**
"I'm working on my estate plan and I'd like your input on [specific decision]. I'm thinking about [option A] or [option B]. What do you think? I want to make sure this works for everyone."

**Why it works:**
- Invites participation
- Shows you value their input
- Reduces resistance
- Collaborative approach

## Rules: No Debate; Schedule a Follow-up Talk

### Rule 1: No Debate

**What this means:**
- This is about sharing information, not debating decisions
- You're informing, not negotiating
- Your decisions are yours to make
- Family can ask questions, but not argue

**If debate starts:**
- "I appreciate your input, but I've thought about this carefully."
- "This is my decision, but I'm happy to explain my reasoning."
- "I understand your concern, but I've made my choice."

---

### Rule 2: Schedule a Follow-up Talk

**Why:**
- First conversation doesn't have to cover everything
- Gives everyone time to process
- Reduces pressure and overwhelm
- Allows for questions later

**How:**
- "This is a lot to take in. Let's talk more about this [specific time]."
- "I know this is important. Can we schedule time to discuss it more?"
- "I've shared the basics. Let's follow up when you've had time to think."

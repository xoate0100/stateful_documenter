## Structure

### Section 1: 4 Core Docs + Why Each Matters

#### Will
**What it is:** Legal document that says who gets your assets after you die and who takes care of your children (if applicable).

**Why it matters:**
- Without a will, state law decides who gets your assets
- You choose who handles your estate (executor)
- You can name guardians for minor children

**Important:** A will doesn't automatically avoid probate.

---

#### Trust
**What it is:** Legal arrangement where you transfer assets to a trustee to manage for beneficiaries.

**Why it matters:**
- Provides control over how assets are distributed
- Can avoid probate (if properly funded)
- Keeps your affairs private (not public record)
- Can provide ongoing management

**Important:** A trust must be funded (assets transferred into it) to work.

---

#### Financial Power of Attorney (POA)
**What it is:** Legal document that names someone to handle your finances if you can't.

**Why it matters:**
- Someone can pay bills, manage accounts, handle finances
- Active while you're alive but incapacitated
- Prevents court-appointed conservatorship
- Gives you control over who acts

**Important:** This is about incapacity, not just death.

---

#### Healthcare Directive
**What it is:** Legal document that names someone to make medical decisions if you can't, plus your end-of-life wishes.

**Why it matters:**
- Someone can make medical decisions for you
- Reduces family conflict during medical crises
- Your wishes are clear and documented
- Protects your dignity and values

**Important:** This protects you and reduces burden on family.

### Section 2: 5 Most Common Pitfalls

1. **Unfunded Trust**
   - Trust exists on paper but assets aren't transferred
   - Trust may not work as intended
   - Assets may still go through probate
   - **Solution:** Transfer assets to trust name (with attorney guidance)

2. **Beneficiary Mismatches**
   - Account beneficiaries override will/trust
   - Outdated beneficiaries (ex-spouse, deceased)
   - Accounts don't align with estate plan
   - **Solution:** Review and update all account beneficiaries

3. **Outdated Documents**
   - Documents created years ago
   - Life events not reflected (marriage, divorce, children, moves)
   - Executors/trustees may be deceased or inappropriate
   - **Solution:** Review after major life events, update as needed

4. **Digital Assets Not Addressed**
   - Digital accounts not accessible to family
   - Photos, memories locked in accounts
   - No password management system
   - **Solution:** Create digital legacy inventory, document access

5. **No Decision-Makers Named**
   - No one knows who should act
   - Family confusion during crisis
   - Court may appoint someone
   - **Solution:** Name financial agent, healthcare agent, executor/trustee

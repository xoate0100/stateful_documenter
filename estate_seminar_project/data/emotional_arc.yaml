emotional_labels:
  before_state:
    definition: "What they feel entering this micro-topic"
    purpose: "Acknowledge where they are emotionally, so you can meet them there"
    examples:
      - "Vague anxiety (Module A)"
      - "Overwhelm, confusion (Module B)"
      - "False confidence (Module C)"
      - "Paralysis (Module D)"
      - "Sterile 'paperwork' vibe (Module E)"
      - "Avoidance (Module F)"
  
  after_state:
    definition: "What they should feel after you teach it"
    purpose: "Define the emotional destination, so content can be designed to achieve it"
    examples:
      - "Conceptual clarity + safety (Module A)"
      - "Simplification; 'this is manageable' (Module B)"
      - "Constructive awareness + motivation (Module C)"
      - "Competence + momentum (Module D)"
      - "Meaning, connection, calm (Module E)"
      - "Permission + self-efficacy (Module F)"

  progression:
    - "Safety"
    - "Clarity"
    - "Competence"
    - "Relief"
    - "Agency"
    - "Peace"
  
  arc_by_module:
    intro: "Establishes Safety"
    module_a: "Safety → Clarity"
    module_b: "Clarity → Competence"
    module_c: "Competence → Relief"
    module_d: "Relief → Agency"
    module_e: "Agency → Peace"
    module_f: "Reinforces Agency and Peace"
    closing: "Reinforces Peace"

forbidden_emotional_triggers:
  panic_doom_guilt:
    - "Panic, doom, guilt-heavy framing"
    - "If you don't do this, your family will suffer"
    - "You're putting your loved ones at risk"
    - "This is a critical mistake"
  
  urgency:
    - "\"If you die tomorrow…\" urgency"
    - "If you die tomorrow without a will..."
    - "What happens if you're in an accident today?"
    - "Time is running out"
  
  shame:
    - "Shame ('You should have done this already')"
    - "You should have done this years ago"
    - "Most people have this done by now"
    - "Why haven't you done this yet?"
  
  why_forbidden:
    - "They trigger the audience's primary fear: 'Here comes the pitch'"
    - "They create urgency that feels like sales pressure"
    - "They violate the 'no sales' compliance rules"
    - "They damage trust and autonomy"

preferred_emotional_triggers:
  relief:
    examples:
      - "This is simpler than I thought"
      - "This is more manageable than it seems"
      - "You don't have to understand everything"
      - "The worksheets make it simple"
  
  control:
    examples:
      - "Here's the next step"
      - "You can start with one worksheet"
      - "Here's what to do next"
      - "You're in control of the process"
  
  dignity:
    examples:
      - "Your wishes deserve clarity"
      - "Your wishes matter"
      - "You deserve clarity about your legacy"
      - "This is about honoring your intentions"
  
  protection:

      - "Reduce burden on family"
      - "This makes it easier for your family"
      - "Planning now is a gift to loved ones"
      - "This reduces confusion and conflict"
  
  why_they_work:
    - "They respect autonomy and control"
    - "They build competence and confidence"
    - "They create positive motivation"
    - "They align with audience values (control, dignity, family harmony)"

atomic_delivery_model:
  definition: "Each module, worksheet, and piece of content has clear before/after states and specific content that moves attendees from before to after"
  
  components:
    - "Clear before state (where they are emotionally)"
    - "Clear after state (where they should be)"
    - "Specific content that moves them from before to after"
    - "Measurable outcome (can verify the emotional shift)"
  
  application:
    for_modules:
      - "Define before/after emotional states"
      - "Design content to achieve the emotional shift"
      - "Verify the shift is happening"
      - "Adjust if needed"
    
    for_worksheets:
      - "Define before/after emotional states"
      - "Design prompts to achieve the shift"
      - "Verify completion creates the outcome"
      - "Adjust if needed"

emotional_engineering_checklist:
  - "Before state is clearly defined"
  - "After state is clearly defined"
  - "Content moves from before to after"
  - "No forbidden emotional triggers used"
  - "Preferred emotional triggers included"
  - "Aligns with required emotional arc"
  - "Respects audience autonomy"
  - "Builds competence, not fear"

integration:
  compliance_alignment:
    - "Emotional engineering supports 'no sales' compliance"
    - "Preferred triggers respect autonomy"
    - "Forbidden triggers are also compliance violations"
    - "Emotional arc builds trust, not pressure"
  
  brand_alignment:
    surewealth_tone: "calm, factual, mathematically/structurally oriented"
    legacy_lock: "guided system (not pressure)"
    both_brands: "align with preferred emotional triggers"

usage_in_content_generation:
  for_slides:
    - "Each slide should support the emotional arc"
    - "Use preferred triggers in slide copy"
    - "Avoid forbidden triggers"
  
  for_worksheets:
    - "Define before/after states for each worksheet"
    - "Design prompts to achieve emotional outcomes"
    - "Include emotional labels if helpful"
  
  for_scripts:
    - "Use emotional language that supports the arc"
    - "Acknowledge before states"
    - "Guide to after states"
    - "Use preferred triggers in transitions"
  
  for_one_pagers:
    - "Support the emotional arc"

**Source:** Lines 516-543 of `evidence/source_material.md`  
**Purpose:** Define accuracy and ethics guardrails that ensure content is truthful, helpful, and compliant

---

## Overview

Guardrails ensure that all content maintains accuracy, ethics, and compliance. These are the "safety rails" that prevent overclaiming, legal advice, and unethical practices.

---

## 1. No Legal Advice

### Requirement

**Always include:**
- "This is educational and not legal advice."
- Encourage consulting a qualified estate attorney for legal decisions.

### When to Include

Include this disclaimer in:
- Any content that touches on legal topics
- Trust funding discussions
- Document creation guidance
- Estate planning recommendations
- Content about wills, trusts, powers of attorney
- State-specific information
- Legal process explanations

### Critical Applications

**Worksheet 6 (Trust Funding Awareness):**
- **REQUIRED DISCLAIMER** must be prominent
- This worksheet specifically requires the disclaimer
- Must appear at top or in prominent location

**Module B (Estate Planning Basics):**
- Definitions are educational
- No recommendations about which documents to use
- Always direct to attorney for legal decisions

**Module C (Pitfalls):**
- Awareness is educational

- Always encourage attorney consultation

### Language Examples

**Good:**

- "This information is for educational purposes only. For legal advice, consult an attorney."
- "This worksheet creates awareness. Consult an attorney for legal specifics."

**Avoid:**

## 2. Do Not Overclaim About Legacy Lock or SureWealth

### Rule

**"Only state what is supported."**

Stick to what's documented in the source material. Don't add capabilities, outcomes, or promises that aren't explicitly stated.

### Legacy Lock - Supported Statements

- Funding emphasis: "If a trust isn't properly funded, it doesn't work"

**Cannot State:**
- Specific outcomes or guarantees
- Claims beyond what's documented
- Comparisons to other platforms
- Pricing or package information
- Unsupported capabilities

### SureWealth - Supported Statements

**Can State:**
- Positioning: "guaranteed strategies," "NO sales hype… Just the facts"
- Typical clients: Nearing retirement or retired; often $250k+ saved; tired of market volatility
- Services: Retirement planning strategies designed to reduce volatility exposure and improve predictability
- Tools: Planning tools/forecasting to clarify retirement income outlook
- Team: Andy Daniels (Founder); emphasis on growing wealth without unnecessary risk/volatility

**Cannot State:**
- Specific investment returns or guarantees
- Promises beyond cited language

## 3. Trust & Skepticism Handling

### Core Principle

**"Never 'sell through fear.'"**

Instead, acknowledge skepticism, reinforce autonomy, and provide real tools.

### Approach

#### Acknowledge Skepticism
- Recognize that attendees may be skeptical
- Don't dismiss their concerns
- Validate their caution
- Understand their perspective

**Language:**
- "I understand you may be skeptical..."
- "It's normal to be cautious..."
- "Your skepticism is valid..."

#### Reinforce Autonomy
- Emphasize they're in control
- No pressure or obligation
- Their choice, their timeline
- Support is optional

**Language:**
- "You're in control of this process..."
- "The choice is yours..."
- "You decide when and if you want help..."
- "No pressure, no obligation..."

#### Provide Real Tools
- Give actual worksheets and resources
- Tools they can use independently
- No purchase required
- Self-directed materials

**Language:**
- "Here are the tools you can use..."
- "These worksheets are yours to keep..."
- "You can do this yourself..."
- "Support is optional if you want it..."

### What NOT to Do

**Never:**
- Use fear to motivate ("If you die tomorrow...")
- Create urgency ("Time is running out...")
- Apply pressure ("You must act now...")
- Dismiss skepticism ("You're wrong to be skeptical...")
- Overcome resistance with sales tactics

### Why This Matters

- Audience's primary fear: "Here comes the pitch"
- Trust is built through education, not pressure
- Autonomy is a core value for this audience
- Real tools demonstrate genuine value

---

## Integration with Compliance

### Compliance Alignment

These guardrails support "no sales" compliance:
- No legal advice = Educational only
- No overclaiming = Accurate brand representation
- No fear tactics = Preferred emotional triggers

### Brand Alignment

- SureWealth: "NO sales hype… Just the facts"
- Legacy Lock: Educational toolkit, not sales pitch
- Both require accuracy and ethics

### Emotional Alignment

- Acknowledge skepticism = Respects audience
- Reinforce autonomy = Preferred emotional trigger (control)
- Provide real tools = Preferred emotional trigger (competence)

---

## Quality Assurance

### Pre-Generation Check

Before generating content:
- [ ] Legal disclaimer included if needed?
- [ ] Only supported statements about brands?
- [ ] No fear tactics?
- [ ] Skepticism acknowledged?
- [ ] Autonomy reinforced?
- [ ] Real tools provided?

### Post-Generation Check

After generating content:
- [ ] Review for legal advice (remove if found)
- [ ] Verify brand statements are supported
- [ ] Check for fear tactics (remove if found)
- [ ] Ensure skepticism is acknowledged
- [ ] Confirm autonomy is reinforced
- [ ] Verify tools are provided

## Examples

### Good (Compliant)

**Legal Disclaimer:**
"This is educational and not legal advice. Consult a qualified estate attorney for legal decisions."

**Brand Mention:**
"Legacy Lock is one example of a guided system with worksheets like the 3WHY and trustee appointment tools."

**Skepticism Handling:**
"I understand you may be skeptical—that's normal. The good news is, today is education only. You're in control, and you can do this yourself. Here are the worksheets to get you started."

### Poor (Non-Compliant)

**Legal Advice:**
"You should transfer all your assets to your trust immediately to avoid probate."

**Overclaiming:**
"Legacy Lock guarantees you'll avoid probate and save thousands in legal fees."

**Fear Tactics:**
"If you die tomorrow without a will, your family will lose everything and face probate court."

**Source:** Lines 417-444 of `evidence/source_material.md`  
**Purpose:** Define the required slide types and writing rules for seminar presentations

---

## Overview

The slide system provides a canonical structure for creating seminar presentations. All slides must follow these rules to maintain compliance and support the emotional arc.

---

## Required Slide Types

The seminar must include these slide types (in order):

### 1. Safety/Expectations
**Purpose:** Establish safety and set expectations  
**Content:**
- "Today is education only—no sales pitch"
- "You'll leave with clear next steps and worksheets"
- "You can do this yourself—help is optional"
- Safety lines from language bank

**Timing:** Opening (first 5 minutes)

---

### 2. Definitions
**Purpose:** Teach core concepts (Module B content)  
**Content:**
- Will definition
- Trust definition
- Financial POA definition
- Healthcare Directive definition

**Timing:** Module B (15 minutes)

---

### 3. Pitfalls
**Purpose:** Create awareness without fear (Module C content)  
**Content:**
- Unfunded trust risk
- Beneficiary mismatches
- Outdated docs
- Digital assets

**Timing:** Module C (10 minutes)

---

### 4. Worksheets Walkthrough
**Purpose:** Introduce worksheet system (Module D content)  
**Content:**
- Overview of 6 worksheets
- "10-minute start" framing
- Organization options
- Neutral Legacy Lock mention (if included)

**Timing:** Module D (15 minutes)

---

### 5. Family Legacy
**Purpose:** Add warmth and meaning (Module E content)  
**Content:**
- Letters, recordings, stories
- Values transfer
- Legacy beyond legal documents

**Timing:** Module E (5 minutes)

---

### 6. Objections Reframed
**Purpose:** Address resistance (Module F content)  
**Content:**
- "No time" → 10-minute progress counts
- "Too complex" → Complexity shrinks when organized
- "Not enough assets" → Incapacity + guardianship + digital still matter
- "I'll do later" → Later becomes harder; organization = kindness

**Timing:** Module F (7 minutes)

---

### 7. Closing Action Plan
**Purpose:** Recap and provide clear next steps  
**Content:**
- Recap promises delivered (6 worksheets)
- Canonical CTA: "Your next step is to complete one worksheet this week. If you get stuck and want help, we're available—no obligation."
- Reinforce: "You can do this yourself. Help is optional."

**Timing:** Closing (5-7 minutes)

---

### 8. Optional Support Spectrum
**Purpose:** Present support options neutrally  
**Content:**
- Path 1: Self-Directed
- Path 2: Guided Validation
- Path 3: Comprehensive Coordination
- "Our work at SureWealth tends to show up in Paths 2 and 3 when people ask for help."

**Timing:** Near end (only if included)

**Compliance:** Must be neutral, no packages/pricing, no urgency

---

## Slide Writing Rules

### Rule 1: Max 1 Idea Per Slide

**What this means:**
- One concept per slide
- One definition per slide
- One point per slide
- Keep it simple and focused

**Why:**
- Easier to understand
- Less overwhelming
- Better retention
- Supports clarity (emotional arc step 2)

**Example:**
- ✅ Good: One slide = "What is a Will?"
- ❌ Bad: One slide = "Will, Trust, POA, and Healthcare Directive all explained"

---

### Rule 2: Avoid Jargon

**What this means:**
- Use plain English
- Explain technical terms
- No legal jargon without explanation
- Simple, clear language

**Why:**
- Audience may not know legal terms
- Reduces confusion
- Supports clarity
- More accessible

**Example:**
- ✅ Good: "A will says who gets your assets after you die"
- ❌ Bad: "A will is a testamentary instrument that directs the disposition of testate property"

---

### Rule 3: Use "Some People Choose…" Language

**What this means:**
- Frame options neutrally
- "Some people choose..."
- "Others prefer..."
- "You can choose..."

**Why:**
- Respects autonomy
- No prescriptive language
- Permission-based
- Supports agency (emotional arc step 5)

**Example:**
- ✅ Good: "Some people choose a trust, others prefer a will. You can choose what fits your situation."
- ❌ Bad: "You need a trust to avoid probate."

---

### Rule 4: Never Imply Urgency or Scarcity

**What this means:**
- No "limited time"
- No "act now"
- No "don't wait"
- No urgency language

**Why:**
- Urgency feels like sales pressure
- Violates "no sales" compliance
- Triggers audience's primary fear
- Damages trust

**Example:**
- ✅ Good: "When you're ready, you can review your documents"
- ❌ Bad: "You must act now before it's too late"

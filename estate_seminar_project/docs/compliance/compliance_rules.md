## Guardrails (Accuracy + Ethics)

### 12.1 No Legal Advice

**Always include:**
- "This is educational and not legal advice."
- Encourage consulting a qualified estate attorney for legal decisions.

**When to include:**
- Any content that touches on legal topics
- Trust funding discussions
- Document creation guidance
- Estate planning recommendations

**Critical:** This disclaimer is **required** for Worksheet 6 (Trust Funding Awareness) and any content that could be construed as legal advice.

### 12.2 Do Not Overclaim About Legacy Lock or SureWealth

**Only state what is supported:**

#### Legacy Lock
- Toolkit components and the platform's document generation description
- Can mention: 3WHY Worksheet, Trustee Appointment Worksheet, Funding Strategy Outline, Family Communication Package
- Can mention: DIY estate planning technology platform, attorney-drafted documents in all 50 states
- Cannot overclaim capabilities or outcomes

#### SureWealth
- Positioning and typical client fit
- Can mention: "guaranteed strategies," "NO sales hype," typical clients ($250k+ saved, near/at retirement)
- Can mention: retirement planning strategies, planning tools/forecasting
- Cannot make promises beyond cited language

**Rule:** Stick to what's documented in the source material. Don't add capabilities or outcomes that aren't explicitly stated.

---

### 12.3 Trust & Skepticism Handling

**Never "sell through fear."**

**Instead:**
- **Acknowledge skepticism** - Recognize that attendees may be skeptical
- **Reinforce autonomy** - Emphasize they're in control
- **Provide real tools** - Give them actual worksheets and resources

**Approach:**
- Don't dismiss their skepticism
- Don't try to overcome it with pressure
- Build trust through education and tools
- Let them decide when/if they want help

---

## Canonical Seminar CTA (The Only One)

**The single CTA allowed in the seminar:**

**"Your next step is to complete one worksheet this week. If you get stuck and want help, we're available—no obligation."**

### Why This Is Compliant

- Preserves the educational contract
- No urgency or pressure
- Permission-based ("if you want")
- Self-directed action (complete worksheet)
- Optional support ("if you get stuck")
- No obligation

### Where This Appears

- Closing of seminar
- Follow-up materials (optional)
- One-Pager C (Support Spectrum) - can include contact info

### What This Does NOT Include

- Booking links
- Scheduling CTAs
- Package descriptions
- Pricing information
- Urgency or scarcity

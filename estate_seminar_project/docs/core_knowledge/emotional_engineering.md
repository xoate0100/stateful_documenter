# Emotional Engineering (Atomic Delivery Model)

**Source:** Lines 117-145 of `evidence/source_material.md`  
**Purpose:** Define the emotional framework that guides all content delivery

---

## Overview

The Emotional Engineering framework ensures that every piece of content moves attendees through a specific emotional journey, from initial skepticism to peace and agency.

---

## 1. Emotional Labels (Use Consistently)

### Before State
**Definition:** What they feel entering this micro-topic

**Purpose:** Acknowledge where they are emotionally, so you can meet them there.

**Examples:**
- Vague anxiety (Module A)
- Overwhelm, confusion (Module B)
- False confidence (Module C)
- Paralysis (Module D)
- Sterile "paperwork" vibe (Module E)
- Avoidance (Module F)

### After State
**Definition:** What they should feel after you teach it

**Purpose:** Define the emotional destination, so content can be designed to achieve it.

**Examples:**
- Conceptual clarity + safety (Module A)
- Simplification; "this is manageable" (Module B)
- Constructive awareness + motivation (Module C)
- Competence + momentum (Module D)
- Meaning, connection, calm (Module E)
- Permission + self-efficacy (Module F)

## 2. Required Emotional Arc (Macro)

The overall seminar must move attendees through this progression:

1. **Safety** → "I'm safe here; no pitch coming"
2. **Clarity** → "I understand what this is"
3. **Competence** → "I can handle this"
4. **Relief** → "This is simpler than I thought"
5. **Agency** → "I'm in control; I can do this"
6. **Peace** → "I have a clear path forward"

### Arc Progression by Module

- **Intro:** Establishes Safety
- **Module A:** Safety → Clarity
- **Module B:** Clarity → Competence
- **Module C:** Competence → Relief
- **Module D:** Relief → Agency
- **Module E:** Agency → Peace
- **Module F:** Reinforces Agency and Peace
- **Closing:** Reinforces Peace

## 3. Forbidden Emotional Triggers

**Never use these emotional triggers:**

### Panic, Doom, Guilt-Heavy Framing
- ❌ "If you don't do this, your family will suffer"
- ❌ "You're putting your loved ones at risk"
- ❌ "This is a critical mistake"

### "If You Die Tomorrow…" Urgency
- ❌ "If you die tomorrow without a will..."
- ❌ "What happens if you're in an accident today?"
- ❌ "Time is running out"

### Shame ("You Should Have Done This Already")
- ❌ "You should have done this years ago"
- ❌ "Most people have this done by now"
- ❌ "Why haven't you done this yet?"

### Why These Are Forbidden
- They trigger the audience's primary fear: "Here comes the pitch"
- They create urgency that feels like sales pressure
- They violate the "no sales" compliance rules
- They damage trust and autonomy

---

## 4. Preferred Emotional Triggers

**Use these emotional triggers:**

### Relief ("This is Simpler Than I Thought")
- ✅ "This is more manageable than it seems"
- ✅ "You don't have to understand everything"
- ✅ "The worksheets make it simple"

### Control ("Here's the Next Step")
- ✅ "You can start with one worksheet"
- ✅ "Here's what to do next"
- ✅ "You're in control of the process"

### Dignity ("Your Wishes Deserve Clarity")
- ✅ "Your wishes matter"
- ✅ "You deserve clarity about your legacy"
- ✅ "This is about honoring your intentions"

### Protection ("Reduce Burden on Family")
- ✅ "This makes it easier for your family"
- ✅ "Planning now is a gift to loved ones"
- ✅ "This reduces confusion and conflict"

### Why These Work
- They respect autonomy and control
- They build competence and confidence
- They create positive motivation
- They align with audience values (control, dignity, family harmony)

## Atomic Delivery Model

### What "Atomic" Means

Each module, worksheet, and piece of content has:
- **Clear before state** (where they are emotionally)
- **Clear after state** (where they should be)
- **Specific content** that moves them from before to after
- **Measurable outcome** (can verify the emotional shift)

### Application

**For Each Module:**
- Define before/after emotional states
- Design content to achieve the emotional shift
- Verify the shift is happening
- Adjust if needed

**For Each Worksheet:**
- Define before/after emotional states
- Design prompts to achieve the shift
- Verify completion creates the outcome
- Adjust if needed

---

## Emotional Engineering Checklist

When creating any content, verify:

- [ ] Before state is clearly defined
- [ ] After state is clearly defined
- [ ] Content moves from before to after
- [ ] No forbidden emotional triggers used
- [ ] Preferred emotional triggers included
- [ ] Aligns with required emotional arc
- [ ] Respects audience autonomy
- [ ] Builds competence, not fear

---

## Integration with Compliance

### Compliance Alignment
- Emotional engineering supports "no sales" compliance
- Preferred triggers respect autonomy
- Forbidden triggers are also compliance violations
- Emotional arc builds trust, not pressure

### Brand Alignment
- SureWealth tone: "calm, factual, mathematically/structurally oriented"
- Legacy Lock: "guided system" (not pressure)
- Both brands align with preferred emotional triggers

---

## Usage in Content Generation

### For Slides
- Each slide should support the emotional arc
- Use preferred triggers in slide copy
- Avoid forbidden triggers

### For Worksheets
- Define before/after states for each worksheet
- Design prompts to achieve emotional outcomes
- Include emotional labels if helpful

### For Scripts
- Use emotional language that supports the arc
- Acknowledge before states
- Guide to after states
- Use preferred triggers in transitions

### For One-Pagers
- Support the emotional arc
- Use preferred triggers
- Avoid forbidden triggers

## Examples

### Good Emotional Engineering
**Module Introduction:**
"Many people feel overwhelmed by estate planning. The good news is, it's simpler than it seems. Today, we'll break it down into manageable pieces. You'll leave with clear next steps and tools you can use yourself."

**Emotional Shift:** Overwhelm → Relief → Agency

### Poor Emotional Engineering
**Module Introduction:**
"If you die without a will, your family will face probate court and lose control. You need to act now before it's too late."

**Emotional Shift:** Safety → Panic → Urgency (forbidden!)

## Notes

- Emotional engineering is not manipulation—it's respectful guidance
- The goal is to help people feel capable, not afraid
- Every piece of content should support the emotional arc
- Before/after states must be authentic and achievable

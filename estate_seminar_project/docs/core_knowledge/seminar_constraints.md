## Compliance Validation Checklist

When generating any seminar content, verify:

- [ ] No product pitches or packages mentioned
- [ ] No price anchoring or pricing information
- [ ] No scarcity tactics ("limited spots", "deadline offers")
- [ ] No testimonials as conversion proof
- [ ] No case studies ending in "then they hired us"
- [ ] No booking links on main slides
- [ ] Permission-based language only ("if you want", "optional", "available if you ask")
- [ ] Educational framing maintained throughout
- [ ] Autonomy-respecting language used
- [ ] Emotional triggers are preferred (relief, control, dignity, protection), not forbidden (panic, doom, guilt, shame)

---

## Notes

- These constraints are **non-negotiable** for maintaining compliance
- All generated content must pass this compliance validation
- The audience's primary concern is being sold to, so every element must reinforce the educational, non-sales nature of the seminar

---

## SureWealth Solutions

### Positioning
SureWealth Solutions positions itself as providing **"guaranteed strategies"** and emphasizes clients being **"in charge"** rather than relying on Wall Street volatility.

### Core Messaging
- Highlights **mathematically verifiable guidance**
- **"NO sales hype… Just the facts."**

### Typical Clients
- Nearing retirement or retired
- Often have **$250,000+ saved** for retirement
- Tired of market volatility

## Legacy Lock (Toolkit + Platform)

### Positioning
Legacy Lock positions itself as a step-by-step **"living system"** using videos + worksheets + guided steps.

### Toolkit Components (Explicitly Listed)
1. **3WHY Worksheet & Videos**
2. **Trustee Appointment Worksheet**
3. **Funding Strategy Outline** (to help properly fund a trust)
4. **Family Communication Package**

### LegacyLock Platform (MyLegacyLock / LegacyLock Software)
Described as a **DIY estate planning technology platform** generating attorney-drafted estate planning documents in all 50 states, including:

- Revocable Living Trust
- Last Will & Testament
- Powers of Attorney
- "and much more"

### Funding Emphasis
**Critical concept:** "If a trust isn't properly funded, it doesn't work" and unfunded assets may go through probate. The toolkit aims to ensure correct funding steps.

### Operational Note
Some MyLegacyLock pages may fail to open due to security token restrictions in automated browsing; rely on the cited accessible sources above for stable claims.

## SureWealth Integration (Compliant, Non-Sales)

### The "Support Spectrum" Slide (Only Near End)

**Neutral framing:**
- **Path 1:** Self-Directed (worksheets + self-review)
- **Path 2:** Guided Validation (second set of eyes)
- **Path 3:** Comprehensive Coordination (complex assets, tax, retirement income coordination)

**Then state:**
"Our work at SureWealth tends to show up in Paths 2 and 3 when people ask for help."

**Critical:** Do not mention packages/pricing. No urgency.

**Why this is compliant:** It explains options rather than soliciting.

### SureWealth Tone Requirements

Because SureWealth claims **"NO sales hype… Just the facts,"** keep language:

- Calm, factual, mathematically/structurally oriented
- Autonomy-respecting
- Zero "high-pressure advisor" cues

### SureWealth "What We Do" (Safe, General Statements)

Only say things supported and non-specific:

- Retirement planning strategies designed to reduce volatility exposure and improve predictability
- Planning tools/forecasting to clarify retirement income outlook
- Clients often near/at retirement; commonly $250k+ saved

**Avoid making promises beyond cited language.**

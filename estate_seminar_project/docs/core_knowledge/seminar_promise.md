# Seminar Promise (What Attendees Get)

**Source:** Lines 92-115 of `evidence/source_material.md`  
**Purpose:** Define the explicit promises made to attendees and the walk-away wins they must receive

---

## The Explicit Promise (Say This Early)

These three statements must be communicated early in the seminar:

1. **"Today is education only."**
2. **"You'll leave with clear next steps and worksheets."**
3. **"You can do this yourself—support is optional later."**

### Why These Matter
- Sets expectations immediately
- Reduces skepticism ("Here comes the pitch")
- Establishes autonomy and control
- Creates safety and trust

## Integration with Emotional Arc

The promise delivery supports the required emotional arc:

1. **Safety** → "Today is education only"
2. **Clarity** → "You'll leave with clear next steps"
3. **Competence** → "You can do this yourself"
4. **Relief** → Worksheets provide structure and reduce overwhelm
5. **Agency** → "Support is optional later"
6. **Peace** → Clear path forward without pressure

## Compliance Notes

- The promise must be stated early and reinforced throughout
- All promises must be kept—no bait-and-switch
- Support is always optional and permission-based
- The educational contract must be preserved
- The single canonical CTA is the only sales-related element allowed

## Usage in Content Generation

When generating seminar content:

1. **Opening slides/script:** Include all three explicit promises
2. **Throughout seminar:** Reinforce that support is optional
3. **Closing:** Recap promises delivered (all six worksheets)
4. **CTA:** Use only the canonical CTA (see compliance section)

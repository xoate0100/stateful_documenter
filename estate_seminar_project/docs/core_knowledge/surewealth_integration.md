# SureWealth Integration (Compliant, Non-Sales)

**Source:** Lines 237-272 of `evidence/source_material.md`  
**Purpose:** Define how to integrate SureWealth Solutions into the seminar while maintaining strict "no sales" compliance

---

## Overview

SureWealth integration must be **compliant, non-sales, and permission-based**. It appears only near the end of the seminar and is framed as an optional support resource, not the reason attendees came.

---

## 1. The "Support Spectrum" Slide (Only Near End)

### Timing
**Critical:** This slide appears **only near the end** of the seminar, not early or throughout.

### Neutral Framing

Present three paths neutrally:

#### Path 1: Self-Directed
- Worksheets + self-review
- DIY approach
- Independent completion

#### Path 2: Guided Validation
- Second set of eyes
- Review and validation
- Support without full coordination

#### Path 3: Comprehensive Coordination
- Complex assets
- Tax coordination
- Retirement income coordination
- Full planning integration

### Then State (Compliant Language)

**"Our work at SureWealth tends to show up in Paths 2 and 3 when people ask for help."**

### Critical Restrictions

- ❌ **Do not mention packages/pricing**
- ❌ **No urgency**
- ❌ **No pressure**
- ❌ **No booking links on main slides**
- ❌ **Not the reason they came**

### Why This Is Compliant

**"It explains options rather than soliciting."**

- Presents options, not pitches
- Permission-based (when people ask)
- No urgency or pressure
- Maintains educational contract

---

## 2. SureWealth Tone Requirements

### Core Principle

Because SureWealth claims **"NO sales hype… Just the facts,"** all language must be:

### Required Tone Elements

#### Calm, Factual, Mathematically/Structurally Oriented
- Use data and structure, not emotion
- Focus on systems and processes
- Avoid hype or excitement
- Present facts neutrally

#### Autonomy-Respecting
- "If you want..."
- "Available if you ask..."
- "Optional support..."
- "Your choice..."

#### Zero "High-Pressure Advisor" Cues
- No urgency language
- No scarcity tactics
- No pressure to decide
- No "limited time" offers
- No pushy language

### Language Examples

#### ✅ Good (Compliant)
- "If your situation is complex, it can be helpful to coordinate retirement, tax, and legacy decisions."
- "Some people find value in having a second set of eyes review their plan."
- "If you ever get stuck, and you want help, we're available—only if you ask."

#### ❌ Bad (Non-Compliant)
- "You need to schedule a consultation today."
- "Limited spots available for our planning package."
- "Don't wait—act now to secure your retirement."
- "Our clients see amazing results—you should too."

---

## 3. SureWealth "What We Do" (Safe, General Statements)

### Rule

**"Only say things supported and non-specific."**

### Safe Statements (Supported)

#### Retirement Planning Strategies
- "Retirement planning strategies designed to reduce volatility exposure and improve predictability"
- Mathematically verifiable guidance
- Strategies independent of Wall Street volatility

#### Planning Tools/Forecasting
- "Planning tools/forecasting to clarify retirement income outlook"
- Tools to understand retirement income
- Forecasting and planning support

#### Typical Client Profile
- "Clients often near/at retirement; commonly $250k+ saved"
- General client characteristics
- Not a requirement, just a description

### Critical Restriction

**"Avoid making promises beyond cited language."**

- Don't overclaim capabilities
- Don't promise specific outcomes
- Don't make guarantees beyond what's stated
- Stick to general, supported statements

## Integration with Seminar Promise

### Alignment

The SureWealth integration supports the seminar promise:

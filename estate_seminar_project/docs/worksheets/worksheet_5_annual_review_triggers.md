## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to review if nothing has changed?**
A: Annual review is good practice, but not required. Focus on triggers first.

**Q: What if multiple triggers have happened?**
A: That's common. Review all documents and update as needed.

**Q: What if I just created my documents?**
A: That's fine. Keep this list for future reference. Documents will need updates as life changes.

**Q: What counts as a "major account change"?**
A: Opening/closing significant accounts, major balance changes, new investment accounts, etc. Use your judgment.

**Q: What if I move states?**
A: State laws differ, so review documents with an attorney in your new state. Some documents may need updating.

## Compliance Notes

- Educational tool only—not legal advice
- No urgency or pressure
- Permission-based (reviews are normal)
- Self-directed completion
- Support is optional
- Remind them to consult attorney for state-specific requirements

---

## Process Mindset vs. Perfectionism

### Perfectionism (Avoid)
- "I must get everything perfect from the start"
- "If I make a mistake, it's a failure"
- "Documents should never need updating"
- "I'm behind if I haven't done this yet"

### Process Mindset (Encourage)
- "Documents evolve with life"
- "Reviews are normal and expected"
- "Updates show I'm staying current"
- "This is an ongoing process, not a one-time event"

---

## Example Completion (For Reference Only)

**Recent Triggers:**
- ☑ New child/grandchild (had a grandchild 2 years ago)
- ☐ Marriage/divorce
- ☐ Move states
- ☐ Home purchase/sale
- ☑ Major account change (opened new investment account)
- ☐ Health change
- ☐ Business change
- ☐ Death in family

**Notes:** Need to update beneficiaries to include grandchild. Documents created 5 years ago, so good time for review anyway.

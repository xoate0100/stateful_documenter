## Worksheet Structure

### Table Format with Columns

#### Column 1: Asset / Account
**Purpose:** List each asset or account

**Examples:**
- Bank accounts (checking, savings, CDs)
- Investment accounts (401k, IRA, brokerage)
- Real estate (home, rental property)
- Life insurance policies
- Retirement accounts
- Business interests

#### Column 2: Approx Value (Range OK)
**Purpose:** Rough estimate of value

**Guidance:** 
- Exact amounts not required
- Ranges are fine (e.g., "$50k-$100k")
- "Unknown" is acceptable
- This is for awareness, not precision

#### Column 3: Owner/Title (Me / Joint / Trust / Unknown)
**Purpose:** Identify how asset is owned/titled

**Options:**
- **Me** - Individual ownership
- **Joint** - Joint ownership (with spouse, etc.)
- **Trust** - Owned by trust
- **Unknown** - Not sure

**Guidance:** This determines if asset will go through probate or follow trust terms.

#### Column 4: Beneficiary Listed? (Y/N/Unknown)
**Purpose:** Check if account has beneficiary designation

**Options:**
- **Y** - Yes, has beneficiary
- **N** - No beneficiary listed
- **Unknown** - Not sure

**Guidance:** Beneficiaries on accounts override will/trust, so this is critical.

#### Column 5: Needs Update? (Y/N)
**Purpose:** Identify which items need attention

**Options:**
- **Y** - Yes, needs update
- **N** - No, current and correct
- Leave blank if unsure

**Guidance:** Mark items where:
- Beneficiary is outdated (ex-spouse, deceased)
- Title doesn't match estate plan
- No beneficiary where one is needed

6. Don't worry about completing everything—this is a start

### For Facilitators

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to list every single account?**
A: No, start with major assets. You can add more later.

**Q: What if I don't know the exact value?**
A: Ranges are fine. This is for awareness, not precision.

**Q: What if my beneficiary is outdated?**
A: Mark it as "Needs Update" and update it when you're ready. This worksheet helps you identify what needs attention.

**Q: What if I have a trust but assets aren't in it?**
A: That's the "unfunded trust" issue. Mark those assets and consider transferring them to the trust (with attorney guidance).

**Q: What if I don't have beneficiaries on accounts?**
A: That's okay to note. You can add beneficiaries later if desired.

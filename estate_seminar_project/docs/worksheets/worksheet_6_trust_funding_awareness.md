## Worksheet Structure

### Section 1: Concept Bullets

#### "A trust may fail to avoid probate if not funded"
**Purpose:** Explain the consequence of unfunded trust

**Explanation:** A trust document alone doesn't protect assets. Assets must be transferred into the trust name for the trust to work.

#### "Funding = aligning titles/ownership/beneficiary structures with intent"
**Purpose:** Define what funding means

**Explanation:** 
- Funding means transferring asset ownership to the trust
- This includes real estate deeds, bank accounts, investment accounts
- Beneficiary designations should align with trust intentions
- Titles and ownership must match the estate plan

### Section 2: Mini-Checklist

Review items:

- ☐ Real estate deeds reviewed
- ☐ Bank accounts titled reviewed
- ☐ Beneficiaries reviewed

**Purpose:** Provide actionable review items

**Guidance:** These are review items, not legal instructions. Consult an attorney for actual funding steps.

### Section 3: Attorney Reminder

**"Ask an attorney for legal specifics" reminder**

**Purpose:** Reinforce that this is educational, not legal advice

**Guidance:** Trust funding involves legal processes (deed transfers, account retitling, etc.) that require attorney guidance. This worksheet creates awareness, not instructions.

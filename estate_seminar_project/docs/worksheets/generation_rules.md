## Examples

### Good Worksheet Opening
**Title:** Legacy Snapshot  
**Subtitle:** 10-Minute Start  
**Purpose:** This worksheet helps you establish a baseline of what you have, where it is, and who knows about it. Start with what you know—you can add more later.

### Poor Worksheet Opening
**Title:** Complete Estate Planning Inventory (Required)  
**Purpose:** You must complete this immediately to avoid critical mistakes. Time is running out.

The first example uses permission-based language and "10-minute start" framing. The second uses urgency and pressure (forbidden).

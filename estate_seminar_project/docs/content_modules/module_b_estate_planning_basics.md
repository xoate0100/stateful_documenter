# Module B — Estate Planning Basics

**Source:** Lines 157-173 of `evidence/source_material.md`  
**Duration:** 15 minutes  
**Position in Seminar:** Second educational module

---

## Purpose

Teach neutral definitions of core estate planning documents and concepts, moving from overwhelm and confusion to simplification and "this is manageable."

---

## Content to Teach

### Core Documents (Neutral Definitions)

#### 1. Will
**Definition:**
- Distribution of assets after death
- Guardianship designation (if applicable)
- **Important:** Doesn't automatically avoid probate

**Key Point:** A will is a starting point, but probate may still be required.

#### 2. Trust
**Definition:**
- Control over asset distribution
- Privacy (avoids public probate)
- Probate avoidance (if properly funded)
- **Critical:** Depends on funding—a trust that isn't funded doesn't work

**Key Point:** Trusts provide control and privacy, but only if assets are properly transferred into them.

#### 3. Financial Power of Attorney (POA)
**Definition:**
- Designates who handles money if you're incapacitated
- Active while you're alive but unable to act
- Different from executor (who acts after death)

**Key Point:** This is about incapacity planning, not just death planning.

#### 4. Healthcare Directive
**Definition:**
- Medical decisions when you can't make them
- Reduces family conflict
- Includes healthcare power of attorney
- Living will component (end-of-life wishes)

**Key Point:** This protects your wishes and reduces burden on family during medical crises.

## Teaching Approach

### Neutral Framing
- Use definitions, not sales language
- Explain what each document does
- Explain limitations honestly
- Frame as tools, not requirements

### Simplification Strategy
- One concept at a time
- Clear, plain English
- Avoid legal jargon
- Connect to real-life scenarios

---

## Atomic Outcomes

### Before State
**Emotional State:** Overwhelm, confusion
- Too many terms and concepts
- Unclear what each document does
- Confusion about which is needed
- Paralysis from complexity

### After State
**Emotional State:** Simplification; "this is manageable"
- Clear understanding of each document's purpose
- Sense that it's not as complex as feared
- Understanding of basic differences
- Confidence that it can be understood

## Emotional Arc Position

This module builds **Clarity** (second step in the required emotional arc):
- Safety → **Clarity** → Competence → Relief → Agency → Peace

---

## Key Teaching Points

### Will
- Not just for the wealthy
- Doesn't avoid probate automatically
- Still important for guardianship and distribution

### Trust
- Funding is critical—must transfer assets
- Provides control and privacy
- Not just for complex estates

### Financial POA
- About incapacity, not just death
- Critical for financial management if disabled
- Different from healthcare decisions

### Healthcare Directive
- Reduces family conflict
- Protects your wishes
- Kindness to family during difficult times

## Common Questions to Anticipate

- "Do I need all of these?" → Frame as tools, choose what fits
- "Which is most important?" → Depends on situation, but all serve different purposes
- "Is a trust better than a will?" → Different tools for different goals
- "What if I can't afford this?" → DIY options exist (Module D)

---

## Integration Points

- **Builds on:** Module A (now they understand it's a process, here are the tools)
- **Leads to:** Module C (Pitfalls) - now that they know the basics, they can understand common mistakes
- **Supports:** Worksheets 1, 2, 3 (document inventory, decision-makers, assets)

---

## Compliance Notes

- Educational definitions only—not legal advice
- No recommendations about which documents to use
- No urgency or pressure
- Neutral, factual presentation
- Maintains "no sales" posture

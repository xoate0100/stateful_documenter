## Purpose

Add warmth and meaning to the estate planning process, moving from sterile "paperwork" vibe to meaning, connection, and calm. This module humanizes the legal/technical aspects.

---

**"Legacy is more than legal documents."**

This module expands the definition of legacy to include values, stories, and family connection.

---

---

## Why This Matters

**"This increases warmth and reduces 'legal-only' coldness."**

- Estate planning can feel cold and technical
- Adding personal elements makes it meaningful
- Family members value stories and values as much as assets
- Creates connection, not just distribution

---

## Atomic Outcomes

### Before State
**Emotional State:** Sterile "paperwork" vibe
- Estate planning feels cold and legal
- Focus only on assets and documents
- Missing the human element
- Lacks meaning and connection

### After State
**Emotional State:** Meaning, connection, calm
- Understanding that legacy includes values
- Sense that this is meaningful work
- Connection to family and future
- Calm from knowing wishes are clear

---

## Emotional Arc Position

This module builds **Peace** (final step in the required emotional arc):
- Safety → Clarity → Competence → Relief → Agency → **Peace**

---

## Teaching Approach

### Do
- Emphasize the human element
- Share examples (generic, not personal)
- Frame as gift to family
- Connect to worksheets (can include values)
- Make it feel warm and meaningful

### Don't
- Don't make it feel required
- Don't create guilt if they haven't done this
- Don't make it sound complicated
- Don't lose the practical focus

---

## Integration with Legal Documents

**Connection:**
- Values can inform legal decisions
- Family communication supports document effectiveness
- Stories help family understand intentions
- Values transfer complements asset distribution

**Balance:**
- Legal documents provide structure
- Values and stories provide meaning
- Both are important
- Neither replaces the other

---

## Practical Suggestions

### Simple Ways to Start
- Write one letter to one family member
- Record one story or memory
- Document one family value or tradition
- Start small—doesn't have to be comprehensive

### When to Do This
- Can be done alongside legal planning
- Can be done separately
- Can be updated over time
- No deadline or urgency

---

## Integration Points

- **Builds on:** All previous modules (adds meaning to the technical)
- **Complements:** Worksheets (can include values in decision-making)
- **Leads to:** Module F (Objections) - addresses "not enough assets" objection
- **Supports:** Overall emotional arc completion (Peace)

## Common Questions to Anticipate

- "Do I have to do this?" → No, it's optional but meaningful
- "What if I'm not a writer?" → Record audio or video, or just talk
- "When should I do this?" → Anytime, no urgency
- "What if my family doesn't care?" → They may value it more than you think

---

## Compliance Notes

- Educational and inspirational, not prescriptive
- No urgency or pressure
- Maintains "no sales" posture
- Personal choice, not requirement
- Complements but doesn't replace legal planning

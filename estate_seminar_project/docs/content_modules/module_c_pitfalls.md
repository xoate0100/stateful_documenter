## Content to Teach

### Four Key Pitfalls

#### 1. Unfunded Trust Risk
**The Problem:**
- Trust exists on paper
- Assets not transferred into trust
- Trust doesn't work as intended
- Assets may still go through probate

**The Solution:**
- Funding is a critical step
- Review asset titles and ownership
- Transfer assets to trust name
- Regular review ensures proper funding

**Teaching Tone:** Informative, not alarming. "This is common and fixable."

#### 2. Beneficiary Mismatches
**The Problem:**
- Accounts have beneficiary designations
- Beneficiaries override will/trust intentions
- Outdated beneficiaries (ex-spouses, deceased relatives)
- Accounts may not align with estate plan

**The Solution:**
- Review all account beneficiaries
- Update beneficiary designations
- Align beneficiaries with estate plan
- Regular review (especially after life events)

**Teaching Tone:** Awareness-building, not fear-mongering. "This is easy to check and update."

#### 3. Outdated Documents
**The Problem:**
- Documents created years ago
- Life events not reflected (marriage, divorce, children, moves)
- Executors/trustees may be deceased or inappropriate
- State laws may have changed

**The Solution:**
- Review documents after major life events
- Update decision-makers as needed
- Review state-specific requirements if moved
- Annual review checklist (Worksheet 5)

**Teaching Tone:** Process-oriented, not guilt-inducing. "This is normal—documents need maintenance."

#### 4. Digital Assets (Access + Memories)
**The Problem:**
- Digital accounts not accessible to family
- Photos, videos, memories locked in accounts
- Financial accounts online only
- No password management system

**The Solution:**
- Digital legacy inventory (Worksheet 4)
- Password management system
- Designate digital executor
- Document access information securely

**Teaching Tone:** Modern reality, not doom. "This is part of modern estate planning."

## Atomic Outcomes

### Before State
**Emotional State:** False confidence
- "I have a will, I'm done"
- "My trust is set up, nothing to worry about"
- "I'll deal with it later"
- Overconfidence without awareness

### After State
**Emotional State:** Constructive awareness + motivation
- Understanding of common pitfalls
- Awareness without panic
- Motivation to review and update
- Sense that these are manageable issues

## Emotional Arc Position

This module builds **Competence** (third step in the required emotional arc):
- Safety → Clarity → **Competence** → Relief → Agency → Peace

---

## Teaching Approach

### Do
- Present pitfalls as common and fixable
- Frame as awareness, not alarm
- Emphasize solutions, not just problems
- Use "this is normal" language
- Connect to worksheets as solutions

### Don't
- Don't use fear tactics ("if you die tomorrow...")
- Don't create urgency or panic
- Don't use guilt ("you should have...")
- Don't make it sound hopeless
- Don't create shame

---

## Reframing Language

### Instead of Fear
- ❌ "If you die without updating..."
- ✅ "When you review your documents..."

### Instead of Urgency
- ❌ "You must do this immediately..."
- ✅ "This is something to review when you're ready..."

### Instead of Guilt
- ❌ "You should have done this already..."
- ✅ "Many people find it helpful to review..."

### Instead of Shame
- ❌ "This is a critical mistake..."
- ✅ "This is common and easily addressed..."

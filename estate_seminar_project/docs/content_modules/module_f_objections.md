# Module F — Objections

**Source:** Lines 219-235 of `evidence/source_material.md`  
**Duration:** 7 minutes  
**Position in Seminar:** Sixth and final educational module (before closing)

---

## Purpose

Reframe common resistance and objections, moving from avoidance to permission and self-efficacy. This module addresses the "why not" so people can move to "why yes."

---

## Core Teaching Approach

**"Reframe, don't dismiss."**

Acknowledge the objection, then reframe it constructively.

---

## Content to Teach

### Four Common Objections and Reframes

#### 1. "No Time"
**The Objection:**
- "I'm too busy"
- "I don't have time for this"
- "This takes too long"

**The Reframe:**
- **"10-minute progress counts"**
- You don't have to do everything at once
- Start with one worksheet (10 minutes)
- Small steps add up
- Better to start than wait for "perfect time"

**Key Message:** "You don't need hours. You need 10 minutes to start."

---

#### 2. "Too Complex"
**The Objection:**
- "This is too complicated"
- "I don't understand all this"
- "It's overwhelming"

**The Reframe:**
- **"Complexity shrinks when organized"**
- The worksheets break it into manageable pieces
- You don't have to understand everything
- Start with what you know
- Organization reduces complexity

**Key Message:** "The worksheets make it simple. Start with one."

---

#### 3. "Not Enough Assets"
**The Objection:**
- "I don't have enough money"
- "This is for rich people"
- "My estate isn't worth it"

**The Reframe:**
- **"Incapacity + guardianship + digital still matter"**
- Estate planning isn't just about money
- Incapacity planning matters regardless of assets
- Guardianship for children matters
- Digital assets and memories matter
- Healthcare decisions matter

**Key Message:** "This isn't just about money. It's about control and protection."

---

#### 4. "I'll Do Later"
**The Objection:**
- "I'll do it when I'm older"
- "I have time"
- "Later is fine"

**The Reframe:**
- **"Later becomes harder; organization = kindness to family"**
- Life events make it more urgent (not less)
- Organization now = less burden on family later
- Incapacity can happen at any age
- Starting now is a gift to your family

**Key Message:** "Later doesn't get easier. Starting now is kindness."

---

## Atomic Outcomes

### Before State
**Emotional State:** Avoidance
- Resistance to taking action
- Justification for delay
- Objections blocking progress
- Paralysis from "why not"

### After State
**Emotional State:** Permission + self-efficacy
- Objections addressed and reframed
- Permission to start small
- Confidence that it's manageable
- Self-efficacy to take action

---

## Emotional Arc Position

This module reinforces **Agency** and **Peace** (final steps in the required emotional arc):
- Safety → Clarity → Competence → Relief → **Agency** → **Peace**

---

## Teaching Approach

### Do
- Acknowledge the objection (don't dismiss it)
- Reframe constructively
- Provide permission to start small
- Connect to worksheets and tools
- Create self-efficacy

### Don't
- Don't dismiss objections
- Don't create urgency or pressure
- Don't use fear ("if you die...")
- Don't create guilt
- Don't make it sound easy (acknowledge it takes effort)

---

## Reframing Language Patterns

### Pattern: Acknowledge → Reframe → Permission

**Example:**
- Acknowledge: "I understand you're busy..."
- Reframe: "The good news is, 10 minutes counts..."
- Permission: "You can start with just one worksheet..."

---

## Integration Points

- **Builds on:** All previous modules (addresses why people resist)
- **Supports:** Module D (DIY System) - gives permission to use the tools
- **Reinforces:** Seminar promise ("You can do this yourself")
- **Leads to:** Closing (now they have permission and tools)

---

## Additional Objections to Anticipate

### "I'm Too Young"
**Reframe:** "Incapacity can happen at any age. Planning now protects you and your family."

### "My Family Will Figure It Out"
**Reframe:** "Planning now makes it easier for them. It's a gift, not a burden."

### "I Don't Know What I Want"
**Reframe:** "The worksheets help you figure that out. Start with what you know."

### "This Costs Too Much"
**Reframe:** "The worksheets are free. You can do this yourself. Help is optional."

## Common Questions to Anticipate

- "What if I still don't have time?" → 10 minutes is all you need to start
- "What if it's still too complex?" → Start with Worksheet 1 (simplest)
- "What if I really don't have assets?" → Incapacity and guardianship still matter
- "What if I really want to wait?" → That's your choice, but later doesn't get easier

---

## Compliance Notes

- Educational reframing, not pressure
- No urgency or fear tactics
- Permission-based, not prescriptive
- Maintains "no sales" posture
- Acknowledges choice and autonomy

## Purpose

## Content to Teach

### Worksheet Walkthrough

Walk through **5 worksheets** (see detailed templates in Section 7 of source material):

1. **Legacy Snapshot** (Worksheet 1)
   - What exists, where it is, who knows
   - Reduces overwhelm, establishes baseline

2. **Decision-Maker Map** (Worksheet 2)
   - Who acts if I can't
   - Reduces family chaos

3. **Asset & Beneficiary Alignment** (Worksheet 3)
   - Inventory of assets and beneficiaries
   - Identifies mismatches and needed updates

4. **Digital Legacy Inventory** (Worksheet 4)
   - Digital assets, accounts, access information
   - Modern estate planning component

5. **Annual Review Triggers** (Worksheet 5)
   - Life events that trigger review
   - Creates permission and process mindset

*(Note: Worksheet 6 - Trust Funding Awareness is covered separately as it requires special disclaimer)*

## Organization Options (Neutral Mention)

Mention organization options neutrally:

- **Binder** - Physical organization system
- **Spreadsheet** - Digital organization system
- **Structured platforms** - Guided systems with worksheets and steps

### Legacy Lock Mention (Compliant)

**How to mention:**
"Legacy Lock is one example of a structured platform that guides the process with worksheets like the 3WHY and trustee appointment tools."

**Critical:** This is an example, not a pitch. Frame as one option among many.

**Alternative framing:**
"Some people like paper binders. Others prefer structured platforms that guide the process with worksheets and steps."

## Atomic Outcomes

### Before State
**Emotional State:** Paralysis
- "I don't know where to start"
- "This is too overwhelming"
- "I'll never get this organized"
- Inaction from complexity

### After State
**Emotional State:** Competence + momentum
- Clear next steps with worksheets
- Sense that it's manageable
- Tools in hand to take action
- Momentum to get started

---

## Emotional Arc Position

This module builds **Relief** and **Agency** (fourth and fifth steps in the required emotional arc):
- Safety → Clarity → Competence → **Relief** → **Agency** → Peace

---

## Teaching Approach

### Do
- Walk through each worksheet clearly
- Show how worksheets connect to each other
- Emphasize "10-minute start" framing
- Create momentum with actionable steps
- Frame as tools they can use independently

### Don't
- Don't make it sound complicated
- Don't create pressure to complete everything
- Don't pitch specific platforms (just mention as examples)
- Don't create perfectionism ("must complete all")

---

## Worksheet Presentation Strategy

### For Each Worksheet:
1. **Name and Purpose** - What it does, why it matters
2. **Key Sections** - What they'll fill out
3. **Time Estimate** - "10-minute start" framing
4. **Emotional Outcome** - What they'll feel after completing it

### Connection Between Worksheets:
- Worksheet 1 (Snapshot) → Shows what exists
- Worksheet 2 (Decision-Makers) → Identifies who acts
- Worksheet 3 (Assets) → Shows what needs alignment
- Worksheet 4 (Digital) → Modern component
- Worksheet 5 (Triggers) → When to review

---

## "10-Minute Start" Framing

**Key Message:** "You don't have to complete everything today. Start with 10 minutes on one worksheet."

This reduces perfectionism and creates permission to begin.

---

## Integration Points

- **Builds on:** Modules A-C (now they have the knowledge, here are the tools)
- **Delivers on:** Seminar promise ("You'll leave with clear next steps and worksheets")
- **Supports:** All walk-away wins
- **Leads to:** Module E (Family & Values) - adds warmth to the process

---

## Common Questions to Anticipate

- "Do I have to complete all worksheets?" → Start with one, do what's useful
- "How long will this take?" → 10 minutes to start, complete at your pace
- "What if I don't know some answers?" → That's okay, fill in what you can
- "Can I do this myself?" → Yes, that's the point—these are DIY tools

---

## Compliance Notes

- Educational tools only—not legal advice
- Worksheets are self-directed
- Platform mentions are examples, not pitches
- No urgency or pressure
- Maintains "no sales" posture
- Support is optional

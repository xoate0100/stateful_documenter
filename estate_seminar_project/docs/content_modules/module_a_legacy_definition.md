# Module A — Legacy Definition

**Source:** Lines 147-155 of `evidence/source_material.md`  
**Duration:** 5 minutes  
**Position in Seminar:** First educational module (after intro)

---

## Key Line

**"Legacy planning is not a legal event; it's a process."**

This is the foundational concept that must be communicated clearly.

---

## Purpose

Establish conceptual clarity about what legacy planning actually is—shifting from vague anxiety to understanding that it's an ongoing process, not a one-time legal transaction.

---

## Content to Teach

### Core Concept
Legacy planning is a **process**, not a single legal event. It involves:
- Ongoing organization and review
- Family communication
- Document maintenance
- Life event adjustments
- Values transfer

### Key Points
- Legacy planning evolves with life changes
- It's about more than just legal documents
- It includes family communication and values
- It's manageable when approached as a process

---

## Atomic Outcomes

### Before State
**Emotional State:** Vague anxiety
- Uncertainty about what legacy planning means
- Overwhelm about where to start
- Fear of complexity
- Confusion about legal vs. process aspects

### After State
**Emotional State:** Conceptual clarity + safety
- Clear understanding that it's a process
- Relief that it's not a one-time overwhelming event
- Sense that it's manageable
- Safety in knowing it can be approached step-by-step

---

## Emotional Arc Position

This module establishes **Safety** (first step in the required emotional arc):
- Safety → Clarity → Competence → Relief → Agency → Peace

---

## Teaching Approach

### Do
- Use the key line prominently
- Emphasize "process" over "event"
- Frame as manageable and ongoing
- Create safety through clarity

### Don't
- Don't create urgency ("if you die tomorrow...")
- Don't use fear tactics
- Don't make it sound like a one-time legal transaction
- Don't create panic about complexity

---

## Integration Points

- **Leads to:** Module B (Estate Planning Basics) - now that they understand it's a process, they can learn the components
- **Supports:** All worksheets (which are process tools)
- **Reinforces:** Seminar promise that "you can do this yourself"

---

## Timing Notes

- 5 minutes is tight—focus on the key line and process concept
- Don't get into details of specific documents yet (that's Module B)
- Save time for questions, but keep it brief

---

## Compliance Notes

- Educational only—no legal advice
- No urgency or fear tactics
- Maintains "no sales" posture
- Supports autonomy and self-efficacy

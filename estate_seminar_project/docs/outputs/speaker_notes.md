## SLIDE 1: Title Slide

**Time:** 30 seconds  
**Purpose:** Welcome and set tone

### What to Say:
"Welcome to 'Legacy, Locked'—an educational estate planning seminar. Today is education only. You'll leave with clear next steps and worksheets you can use yourself."

### Key Points:
- Keep it brief
- Immediately establish "education only"
- No need to introduce yourself extensively
- Move quickly to Slide 2 (the important one)

### Transition:
"Let me start by making some promises about what today will and won't be."

---

## SLIDE 2: Safety & Expectations (REQUIRED - Early)

**Time:** 4-5 minutes  
**Purpose:** Establish safety and reduce skepticism  
**Critical:** This is the most important slide—don't rush it

### What to Say:

**Opening:**
"Before we dive in, I want to make some promises about what today is and isn't."

**Today's Promise:**
"Today is education only—no sales pitch. I'm not here to sell you anything. I'm here to give you tools and information you can use yourself."

**What You'll Get:**
"You'll leave today with six worksheets you can use independently. You'll have a clear understanding of estate planning basics. You'll be aware of common pitfalls. And you'll have tools to take action—on your own timeline."

**What You Won't Get:**
"You won't get sales pitches or product packages. You won't get urgency or pressure. You won't get required follow-up commitments. If you want help later, that's your choice—not my requirement."

**Safety Line (Use This Exact Language):**
"No one is behind—most families don't have this organized. So wherever you are in this process, you're in good company."

**Reinforce Autonomy:**
"You can do this yourself. Help is optional. Take what's useful; ignore what isn't."

### Key Points:
- Say "no sales pitch" explicitly
- Use the exact safety lines from the language bank
- Make eye contact—build trust
- Pause after each promise—let it sink in
- Watch for skeptical body language—acknowledge it if you see it

### Common Reactions:
- **Skeptical looks:** Normal. Say: "I know you might be skeptical—that's normal. I'm going to prove this is education only."
- **Questions about cost:** "Today is free. If you want help later, that's optional and you decide when."

### Transition:
"Now that we've established what today is, let's talk about what legacy planning actually is."

---

## SLIDE 3: Module A - Legacy Definition

**Time:** 5 minutes  
**Purpose:** Establish that legacy planning is a process, not an event  
**Emotional Goal:** Move from vague anxiety → conceptual clarity + safety

### What to Say:

**Key Line (Say This Prominently):**
"Legacy planning is not a legal event—it's a process."

**Explain:**
"Many people think estate planning is a one-time thing: you create documents, you're done. But that's not how it works. Legacy planning evolves with your life. It's about more than just legal documents—it includes family communication, values, and ongoing organization."

**Why This Matters:**
"This means you don't have to do everything at once. You can start with one step. You can build over time. It's manageable when you approach it as a process, not a one-time event."

**Permission Language:**
"You don't have to have everything perfect from the start. Documents evolve. Plans evolve. That's normal and expected."

### Key Points:
- Emphasize the key line: "process, not event"
- Use permission language ("you don't have to...")
- Avoid urgency ("you can start when you're ready")
- Create safety ("this is manageable")

### Common Questions:
- **"How long does this take?"** → "It's a process. Start with one worksheet this week. Build from there."
- **"Do I need an attorney?"** → "For legal documents, yes. But you can organize and prepare first. The worksheets help you do that."

### Transition:
"Now that we understand it's a process, let's talk about the basic tools—the four core documents."

---

## SLIDE 4: Module B - Estate Planning Basics

**Time:** 15 minutes (this is the longest module)  
**Purpose:** Teach neutral definitions of core documents  
**Emotional Goal:** Move from overwhelm/confusion → simplification; "this is manageable"

### What to Say:

**Introduction:**
"Let's talk about the four core documents. I'm going to explain what each one does in plain English. No legal jargon—just what you need to know."

**1. Will:**
"A will says who gets your assets after you die. If you have minor children, it names guardians. Important point: A will doesn't automatically avoid probate. It's a starting point, but probate may still be required."

**2. Trust:**
"A trust provides control over how your assets are distributed. It can avoid probate—if it's properly funded. It keeps your affairs private—not public record. Critical point: A trust must be funded to work. We'll talk more about funding in a moment."

**3. Financial Power of Attorney:**
"This names someone to handle your money if you can't. It's active while you're alive but incapacitated. It's different from an executor—who acts after you die. This is about incapacity planning, not just death planning."

**4. Healthcare Directive:**
"This names someone to make medical decisions if you can't. It reduces family conflict during medical crises. It protects your wishes and values. It's a gift to your family—makes difficult times easier."

**Simplification Language:**
"These are just tools. You don't need all of them. You choose what fits your situation. The worksheets will help you figure that out."

### Key Points:
- Use plain English—avoid legal jargon
- Explain limitations honestly (will doesn't avoid probate automatically)
- Emphasize "tools" not "requirements"
- Create permission ("you choose what fits")

### Timing Breakdown:
- Will: ~3 minutes
- Trust: ~4 minutes (including funding mention)
- Financial POA: ~3 minutes
- Healthcare Directive: ~3 minutes
- Q&A/Clarification: ~2 minutes

### Common Questions:
- **"Do I need all four?"** → "No. You choose what fits your situation. The worksheets help you figure that out."
- **"Which is most important?"** → "Depends on your situation. Healthcare directive is important for everyone. Trust vs. will depends on your goals."
- **"What if I can't afford this?"** → "The worksheets are free. You can do this yourself. Help is optional."

### Transition:
"Let me pause on trusts for a moment because there's a critical concept many people don't understand."

---

## SLIDE 5: Module B - Trust Funding (Critical Concept)

**Time:** 2-3 minutes (part of Module B time)  
**Purpose:** Create awareness of trust funding requirement  
**Emotional Goal:** Awareness without panic

### What to Say:

**Critical Line (Say This Exactly):**
"A trust that isn't properly funded may not work as intended."

**Explain:**
"Many people think: 'I have a trust, I'm done.' But a trust document alone doesn't protect your assets. The assets must be transferred into the trust name. That's what 'funding' means—aligning titles and ownership with your intent."

**Why It Matters:**
"If your trust isn't funded, those assets may still go through probate. The trust document exists, but it doesn't control assets that aren't in it."

**Disclaimer (Required):**
"This is educational, not legal advice. Consult an attorney for legal specifics on funding your trust."

**Permission Language:**
"This is common and fixable. If you have a trust, review it with an attorney. The worksheets will help you identify what needs attention."

### Key Points:
- Use the exact trust funding line from language bank
- Include the disclaimer prominently
- Frame as awareness, not alarm
- Direct to attorney for specifics

### Common Questions:
- **"How do I fund my trust?"** → "That's a legal process. Consult an attorney. The worksheets help you identify what needs attention."
- **"Can I do it myself?"** → "Some assets can be retitled yourself, but it's recommended to work with an attorney to ensure it's done correctly."

### Transition:
"Now that we understand the basics, let's talk about common pitfalls—so you can avoid them."

---

## SLIDE 6: Module C - Pitfalls (Teach Without Fear)

**Time:** 10 minutes  
**Purpose:** Create awareness without panic  
**Emotional Goal:** Move from false confidence → constructive awareness + motivation

### What to Say:

**Opening:**
"Let's talk about common pitfalls. I'm going to teach these without fear—they're common, they're fixable, and awareness is the first step."

**1. Unfunded Trust Risk:**
"This is what we just discussed. Trust exists on paper, but assets aren't transferred. Solution: Review and transfer assets with attorney guidance. This is common and fixable."

**2. Beneficiary Mismatches:**
"Account beneficiaries override your will or trust. So if your 401k has an ex-spouse as beneficiary, that's who gets it—regardless of what your will says. Solution: Review and update all account beneficiaries. This is easy to check and update."

**3. Outdated Documents:**
"Documents created years ago may not reflect life events—marriage, divorce, children, moves. Solution: Review after major life events. This is normal—documents need maintenance."

**4. Digital Assets:**
"Digital accounts not accessible to family. Photos, memories locked in accounts. Solution: Create digital legacy inventory. This is part of modern estate planning."

**Reframing Language:**
"These aren't failures—they're normal. Most people have at least one of these issues. The worksheets will help you identify and address them."

### Key Points:
- Use "teach without fear" approach
- Frame as common and fixable
- Avoid alarm language
- Use "this is normal" language
- Connect to worksheets as solutions

### Forbidden Language (Don't Use):
- ❌ "If you die tomorrow..."
- ❌ "This is a critical mistake..."
- ❌ "You should have done this already..."
- ✅ "This is common and fixable..."
- ✅ "When you review your documents..."

### Common Questions:
- **"How do I know if my trust is funded?"** → "Review asset titles and ownership. The worksheets help you identify what needs attention."
- **"What if my beneficiaries are wrong?"** → "Update them—it's usually simple. The worksheets help you identify what needs updating."

### Transition:
"Now that you're aware of the pitfalls, let's talk about the tools to address them—the worksheet system."

---

## SLIDE 7: Module D - DIY System Introduction

**Time:** 2 minutes (introduction only)  
**Purpose:** Introduce the worksheet system  
**Emotional Goal:** Move from paralysis → competence + momentum

### What to Say:

**Key Message:**
"You can do this yourself. Here are the tools."

**The Worksheet System:**
"You're going to get six worksheets today. You can start with 10 minutes on one worksheet. Complete them at your own pace. These are tools you can use independently."

**Organization Options:**
"Some people like paper binders. Others prefer structured platforms that guide the process with worksheets and steps. Legacy Lock is one example of a guided system with worksheets like the 3WHY and trustee appointment tools."

**Permission Language:**
"You don't have to complete everything today. Start with one worksheet this week. Build from there."

### Key Points:
- Emphasize "you can do this yourself"
- "10-minute start" framing
- Neutral Legacy Lock mention (example, not pitch)
- Permission to start small

### Common Questions:
- **"Do I have to do all worksheets?"** → "No. Start with one. Do what's useful."
- **"How long will this take?"** → "10 minutes to start. Complete at your own pace."

### Transition:
"Let me walk you through each worksheet quickly so you know what you're getting."

---

## SLIDE 8: Module D - Worksheet 1: Legacy Snapshot

**Time:** 2 minutes  
**Purpose:** Introduce first worksheet  
**Emotional Goal:** Uncertain, scattered → Oriented, relieved

### What to Say:

**What It Does:**
"This worksheet helps you establish a baseline. What documents do you have? Where are they stored? Who knows where they are? And what's your immediate next step?"

**10-Minute Start:**
"Check off documents you have. Write where they're stored—both physical and digital. List who knows where they are. Then choose ONE next step. You don't have to do everything—just one step."

**Emotional Outcome:**
"This moves you from feeling uncertain and scattered to feeling oriented and relieved. You'll know what you have and where to start."

### Key Points:
- Emphasize "choose ONE next step"
- "10-minute start" framing
- Permission to start small

### Transition:
"Next worksheet helps you think about who acts if you can't."

---

## SLIDE 9: Module D - Worksheet 2: Decision-Maker Map

**Time:** 2 minutes  
**Purpose:** Introduce decision-maker worksheet  
**Emotional Goal:** Discomfort → Responsible confidence

### What to Say:

**What It Does:**
"This helps you identify who will act on your behalf if you can't. Financial agent, healthcare agent, executor or successor trustee. Each with a backup."

**10-Minute Start:**
"Start with primary choices. Backups can be added later. Write brief notes about why you chose them—helps with future review and family understanding."

**Emotional Outcome:**
"This moves you from discomfort—uncomfortable thinking about incapacity—to responsible confidence. You'll know your family knows what to do."

### Key Points:
- Acknowledge the discomfort ("this is hard to think about")
- Permission to start with primary choices only
- Backups are optional initially

### Common Questions:
- **"What if I don't have someone I trust?"** → "That's okay. Leave it blank and revisit later. Some people choose professional trustees."
- **"Can the same person be multiple roles?"** → "Yes, but consider the workload. Having backups is important."

### Transition:
"Next worksheet helps you check if your assets align with your intentions."

---

## SLIDE 10: Module D - Worksheet 3: Asset & Beneficiary Alignment

**Time:** 3 minutes  
**Purpose:** Introduce asset alignment worksheet  
**Emotional Goal:** Avoidance → Clarity + urgency without panic

### What to Say:

**What It Does:**
"This helps you inventory your assets, check ownership and title, and verify beneficiary designations. It identifies mismatches between accounts and your estate plan intentions."

**10-Minute Start:**
"Start with major assets. Approximate values are fine—ranges are okay. Mark items that need updating. You don't need to list every single account—just the major ones."

**Emotional Outcome:**
"This moves you from avoidance—don't want to think about assets—to clarity. You'll know what needs attention, without panic."

**Connection to Pitfalls:**
"This addresses the beneficiary mismatch pitfall we talked about earlier."

### Key Points:
- Emphasize "start with major assets"
- "Ranges are fine" for values
- "Needs update" creates awareness without panic
- Connect to Module C (pitfalls)

### Common Questions:
- **"Do I need to list every account?"** → "No. Start with major assets. You can add more later."
- **"What if I don't know exact values?"** → "Ranges are fine. This is for awareness, not precision."

### Transition:
"Next worksheet addresses something many people haven't thought about—digital assets."

---

## SLIDE 11: Module D - Worksheet 4: Digital Legacy Inventory

**Time:** 2 minutes  
**Purpose:** Introduce digital legacy worksheet  
**Emotional Goal:** Blind spot → Modern confidence

### What to Say:

**What It Does:**
"This helps you inventory your digital assets—email, photos, banking, subscriptions, social media, devices. It ensures family can access what they need."

**10-Minute Start:**
"Focus on major categories—email, photos, banking. List key accounts. Note where passwords are stored. You don't need to list every single account—just the important ones."

**Emotional Outcome:**
"This moves you from blind spot—haven't thought about digital assets—to modern confidence. You'll know your digital legacy is handled."

**Why This Matters:**
"Much of our lives exist in digital form now. Photos, memories, financial accounts. This is part of modern estate planning."

### Key Points:
- Acknowledge this is new for many people
- "Focus on major categories"
- Password management is important but can be addressed over time

### Common Questions:
- **"Do I need to list every account?"** → "No. Focus on important accounts—email, photos, banking, major subscriptions."
- **"What about password security?"** → "Use a secure password manager if possible. The worksheet helps you document where passwords are stored."

### Transition:
"Next worksheet helps you know when to review your estate plan."

---

## SLIDE 12: Module D - Worksheet 5: Annual Review Triggers

**Time:** 2 minutes  
**Purpose:** Introduce review triggers worksheet  
**Emotional Goal:** Perfectionism → Permission + process mindset

### What to Say:

**What It Does:**
"This lists life events that should trigger an estate plan review. Marriage, divorce, new child, move states, home purchase, major account change, health change, business change, death in family."

**Key Message:**
"Reviews are normal and expected. Documents evolve with life. This isn't about perfection—it's about process."

**Emotional Outcome:**
"This moves you from perfectionism—feel like documents must be perfect from the start—to permission. You'll understand that reviews are normal, not a sign of failure."

### Key Points:
- "Reviews are normal" language
- Process mindset, not perfectionism
- Life changes are expected

### Common Questions:
- **"Do I need to review if nothing changed?"** → "Annual review is good practice, but not required. Focus on triggers first."
- **"What if multiple triggers happened?"** → "That's common. Review all documents and update as needed."

### Transition:
"Last worksheet is specifically about trust funding—if you have a trust."

---

## SLIDE 13: Module D - Worksheet 6: Trust Funding Awareness

**Time:** 2 minutes  
**Purpose:** Introduce trust funding worksheet with disclaimer  
**Emotional Goal:** Unaware → Aware and informed  
**Critical:** Must include disclaimer

### What to Say:

**Disclaimer First (Required):**
"This worksheet is educational, not legal advice. Ask a qualified estate attorney for legal specifics."

**What It Does:**
"This creates awareness about trust funding—the critical concept we discussed earlier. A trust that isn't properly funded may not work as intended."

**Review Checklist:**
"Real estate deeds reviewed. Bank accounts titled reviewed. Beneficiaries reviewed. These are review items, not legal instructions."

**Attorney Reminder:**
"Trust funding involves legal processes—deed transfers, account retitling—that require attorney guidance. This worksheet creates awareness, not instructions."

### Key Points:
- **Disclaimer must be prominent**
- Educational only, not legal advice
- Always direct to attorney for specifics
- Awareness, not instructions

### Common Questions:
- **"How do I fund my trust?"** → "That's a legal process. Consult an attorney. This worksheet helps you identify what needs attention."
- **"Can I do it myself?"** → "Some assets can be retitled yourself, but it's recommended to work with an attorney to ensure it's done correctly."

### Transition:
"Now let's talk about something that makes this process meaningful—not just legal."

---

## SLIDE 14: Module E - Family & Values Legacy

**Time:** 5 minutes  
**Purpose:** Add warmth and meaning to the process  
**Emotional Goal:** Sterile "paperwork" vibe → Meaning, connection, calm

### What to Say:

**Key Message:**
"Legacy is more than legal documents. It includes your values, stories, and family connection."

**What It Includes:**
"Letters to family members. Recordings—video or audio messages. Stories and family history. Values transfer—what matters most to you."

**Why This Matters:**
"This adds warmth and meaning to the process. Family members value stories and values as much as assets. It creates connection, not just distribution. It reduces the 'legal-only' coldness."

**Simple Ways to Start:**
"Write one letter to one family member. Record one story or memory. Document one family value. Start small—doesn't have to be comprehensive."

**Emotional Outcome:**
"This moves you from sterile 'paperwork' vibe—estate planning feels cold and legal—to meaning and connection. You'll understand that legacy includes both what you leave and how you're remembered."

### Key Points:
- Warm, meaningful tone
- Human element, not just legal
- "Start small" permission
- Values complement legal documents

### Common Questions:
- **"Do I have to do this?"** → "No, it's optional but meaningful."
- **"What if I'm not a writer?"** → "Record audio or video, or just talk. It doesn't have to be written."
- **"When should I do this?"** → "Anytime. No urgency. Can be done alongside legal planning or separately."

### Transition:
"Now let's address the objections—the reasons people put this off."

---

## SLIDE 15: Module F - Objections Reframed

**Time:** 7 minutes  
**Purpose:** Address resistance and reframe objections  
**Emotional Goal:** Avoidance → Permission + self-efficacy

### What to Say:

**Opening:**
"Let's talk about the objections—the reasons people put this off. Your objections are valid, and they're also addressable."

**"No Time"**
"Many people say they don't have time. Here's the reframe: 10-minute progress counts. You don't need hours. You need 10 minutes to start. Start with one worksheet. Small steps add up."

**"Too Complex"**
"Many people say it's too complicated. Here's the reframe: Complexity shrinks when organized. The worksheets break it into manageable pieces. You don't have to understand everything—start with what you know."

**"Not Enough Assets"**
"Many people say they don't have enough assets. Here's the reframe: Incapacity and guardianship still matter. Digital assets matter. Healthcare decisions matter. This isn't just about money—it's about control and protection."

**"I'll Do Later"**
"Many people say they'll do it later. Here's the reframe: Later becomes harder. Life events make it more urgent, not less. Organization now is kindness to family later. Starting now is a gift to your family."

**Permission Language:**
"Your objections are valid. And they're also addressable. You have permission to start small. You have the tools. The choice is yours—no pressure, no obligation."

### Key Points:
- Acknowledge objections (don't dismiss)
- Reframe constructively
- Provide permission to start small
- Create self-efficacy

### Forbidden Language (Don't Use):
- ❌ "You must act now..."
- ❌ "Time is running out..."
- ✅ "When you're ready..."
- ✅ "You can start with..."

### Common Questions:
- **"What if I still don't have time?"** → "10 minutes is all you need to start. One worksheet. That's it."
- **"What if it's still too complex?"** → "Start with Worksheet 1—it's the simplest. The worksheets make it manageable."

### Transition:
"Let's wrap up with what you're taking with you today."

---

## SLIDE 16: Closing - Action Plan

**Time:** 3-4 minutes  
**Purpose:** Recap promises and provide clear next steps  
**Emotional Goal:** Reinforce peace and agency

### What to Say:

**Recap What You're Taking:**
"Let's recap what you're taking with you today. Six walk-away wins:"

"One: Legacy Snapshot—what exists, where it is, who knows."

"Two: Decision-Maker Map—who acts if I can't."

"Three: Asset & Beneficiary Alignment checklist."

"Four: Digital Legacy Inventory."

"Five: Annual Review Trigger list."

"Six: Trust Funding Awareness checklist—if you have a trust."

**Your Next Step:**
"Your next step is to complete one worksheet this week. That's it. One worksheet. 10 minutes. You choose which one."

**Reinforce Autonomy:**
"Remember: You can do this yourself. Help is optional. Start with 10 minutes. No pressure, no obligation."

### Key Points:
- Recap all six deliverables
- Clear, simple next step
- Reinforce autonomy
- No pressure language

### Transition (If Including Support Spectrum):
"If you want to know about support options, I'll cover that next. If not, we can wrap up."

---

## SLIDE 17: Optional - Support Spectrum (Only Near End)

**Time:** 2-3 minutes (only if included)  
**Purpose:** Present support options neutrally  
**Emotional Goal:** Informative, not sales

### What to Say:

**Neutral Framing:**
"There are three paths people can take. You choose what fits."

**Path 1: Self-Directed**
"Use the worksheets yourself. Review and complete independently. Make decisions on your own."

**Path 2: Guided Validation**
"Complete worksheets yourself. Get a second set of eyes to review. Professional validation of your work."

**Path 3: Comprehensive Coordination**
"Full coordination of complex situations. Integration of retirement, tax, and legacy planning. Professional guidance throughout."

**SureWealth Mention (Neutral):**
"Our work at SureWealth tends to show up in Paths 2 and 3 when people ask for help."

**Critical Restrictions:**
"No packages or pricing mentioned. No urgency. Support is optional. Only if you ask."

### Key Points:
- Neutral, educational framing
- No packages or pricing
- No urgency
- Permission-based only
- Explains options, doesn't solicit

### Common Questions:
- **"What does this cost?"** → "Today is education only. If you want help later, that's optional and you can ask about it then."
- **"Do I need this?"** → "No. You can do this yourself. Help is optional if you want it."

### Transition:
"Let me close with a final reminder."

---

## SLIDE 18: Closing - Final Reminder

**Time:** 1-2 minutes  
**Purpose:** Final CTA and reinforcement  
**Emotional Goal:** Reinforce peace

### What to Say:

**Canonical CTA (Say This Exactly):**
"Your next step is to complete one worksheet this week. If you get stuck and want help, we're available—no obligation."

**Final Reinforcement:**
"Remember: Today was education only. You have the tools—six worksheets. You can do this yourself. Help is optional if you want it."

**Thank You:**
"Thank you for your time. I hope this was helpful."

### Key Points:
- Use exact canonical CTA
- Reinforce "education only"
- Reinforce autonomy
- Thank them

### Transition to Q&A:
"Before we wrap up, I'm happy to answer questions. Remember: No follow-up requirement from today. If you have questions, I'm happy to answer them. If you want help later, we're available—only if you ask."

---

## Q&A Handling

### Transition to Q&A:
"No follow-up requirement from today. If you have questions, I'm happy to answer them. If you want help later, we're available—only if you ask."

### Answering Questions:

**General Approach:**
- Answer factually
- No pressure or urgency
- Permission-based language
- Educational framing

**Common Questions & Answers:**

**"Do I need an attorney?"**
"Yes, for legal documents. But you can organize and prepare first. The worksheets help you do that. Then you can work with an attorney more efficiently."

**"How much does this cost?"**
"Today is free. The worksheets are free. If you want help later, that's optional and you can ask about it then."

**"What if I have a trust already?"**
"Great. Use Worksheet 6 to review if it's properly funded. That's the critical piece—funding."

**"Can I do this myself?"**
"Absolutely. That's the point. The worksheets are designed for self-directed use. Help is optional if you want it."

**"What's the next step?"**
"Complete one worksheet this week. That's it. Start with 10 minutes. Choose whichever worksheet feels most relevant to you."

**"Do I need all the documents?"**
"No. You choose what fits your situation. The worksheets help you figure that out."

**"What if I don't know some answers?"**
"That's okay. Fill in what you can. The worksheets are a starting point, not a test."

**"How often should I review?"**
"After major life events. Or annually. The Annual Review Triggers worksheet helps you know when."

**"What about digital assets?"**
"That's Worksheet 4. Many people haven't thought about this. It's part of modern estate planning."

**"Is this legal advice?"**
"No. This is educational. For legal advice, consult a qualified estate attorney."

### Ending Q&A:
"If there are no more questions, thank you again for your time. Remember: Your next step is to complete one worksheet this week. If you get stuck and want help, we're available—no obligation."

## Troubleshooting

### If Technology Fails:
- Have printed slides as backup
- Can deliver without slides
- Focus on worksheets and handouts

### If Running Short on Time:
- Prioritize Slides 2, 4, 6, 7, 16, 18
- Can summarize worksheets quickly
- Ensure closing is complete

### If Running Long:
- Watch timer
- Can shorten Module B if needed
- Ensure closing is complete
- Don't skip Slide 2 or closing

### If Audience is Skeptical:
- Acknowledge skepticism: "I know you might be skeptical—that's normal."
- Reinforce "no sales" message
- Use safety lines more frequently
- Build trust through education

### If Questions Get Off-Track:
- Gently redirect: "That's a great question. Let me address that briefly, then we can talk more after."
- Keep focus on education
- Don't get into sales territory

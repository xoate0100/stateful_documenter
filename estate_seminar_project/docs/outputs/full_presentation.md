## Slide 3: Module A - Legacy Definition

### Legacy Planning is Not a Legal Event

**It's a Process**

- Legacy planning evolves with life changes
- It's about more than just legal documents
- It includes family communication and values
- It's manageable when approached as a process

**Key Point:**  
You don't have to do everything at once. Start with one step.

**Before:** Vague anxiety  
**After:** Conceptual clarity + safety

---

## Slide 4: Module B - Estate Planning Basics

### The Four Core Documents

**1. Will**
- Says who gets your assets after you die
- Names guardians for children (if applicable)
- **Important:** Doesn't automatically avoid probate

**2. Trust**
- Provides control over asset distribution
- Can avoid probate (if properly funded)
- Keeps your affairs private
- **Critical:** Must be funded to work

**3. Financial Power of Attorney**
- Names someone to handle money if you can't
- Active while you're alive but incapacitated
- Prevents court-appointed conservatorship

**4. Healthcare Directive**
- Names someone to make medical decisions
- Reduces family conflict during medical crises
- Protects your wishes and values

**Before:** Overwhelm, confusion  
**After:** Simplification; "this is manageable"

---

## Slide 5: Module B - Trust Funding (Critical Concept)

### A Trust That Isn't Properly Funded May Not Work as Intended

**What "Funding" Means:**
- Transferring assets into the trust name
- Aligning titles/ownership with your intent
- Ensuring beneficiaries match your plan

**Why It Matters:**
- A trust document alone doesn't protect assets
- Assets must be transferred to the trust
- Unfunded assets may still go through probate

**This is educational, not legal advice. Consult an attorney for legal specifics.**

---

## Slide 6: Module C - Pitfalls (Teach Without Fear)

### Four Common Pitfalls

**1. Unfunded Trust Risk**
- Trust exists on paper but assets aren't transferred
- **Solution:** Review and transfer assets (with attorney guidance)

**2. Beneficiary Mismatches**
- Account beneficiaries override will/trust
- Outdated beneficiaries (ex-spouse, deceased)
- **Solution:** Review and update all account beneficiaries

**3. Outdated Documents**
- Documents created years ago
- Life events not reflected
- **Solution:** Review after major life events

**4. Digital Assets (Access + Memories)**
- Digital accounts not accessible to family
- Photos, memories locked in accounts
- **Solution:** Create digital legacy inventory

**Before:** False confidence  
**After:** Constructive awareness + motivation

---

## Slide 7: Module D - DIY System Introduction

### You Can Do This Yourself

**The Worksheet System:**
- 6 worksheets to guide you
- Start with 10 minutes on one worksheet

**Before:** Paralysis  
**After:** Competence + momentum

## Slide 13: Module D - Worksheet 6: Trust Funding Awareness

### Educational Only - Not Legal Advice

**Critical Concept:**

- Funding = aligning titles/ownership/beneficiary structures with intent

**Review Checklist:**

- Beneficiaries reviewed

**Important:** Ask an attorney for legal specifics on funding your trust.

**This is educational, not legal advice.**

## Slide 14: Module E - Family & Values Legacy

### Legacy is More Than Legal Documents

**Family & Values Legacy Includes:**
- Letters to family members
- Recordings (video or audio messages)
- Stories and family history
- Values transfer

**Why This Matters:**
- Adds warmth and meaning to the process
- Family members value stories as much as assets
- Creates connection, not just distribution
- Reduces "legal-only" coldness

**Simple Ways to Start:**
- Write one letter to one family member
- Record one story or memory
- Document one family value
- Start small—doesn't have to be comprehensive

**Before:** Sterile "paperwork" vibe  
**After:** Meaning, connection, calm

---

## Slide 15: Module F - Objections Reframed

### Common Concerns Addressed

**"No Time"**  
→ 10-minute progress counts. Start with one worksheet.

**"Too Complex"**  
→ Complexity shrinks when organized. The worksheets make it simple.

**"Not Enough Assets"**  
→ Incapacity + guardianship + digital still matter. It's not just about money.

**"I'll Do Later"**  
→ Later becomes harder. Organization = kindness to family.

**Your objections are valid, and they're also addressable.**

**Before:** Avoidance  
**After:** Permission + self-efficacy

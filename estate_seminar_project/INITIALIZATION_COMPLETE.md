## Usage

This project follows the stateful_documenter framework:

1. **Active Plan:** Reference `6_ai_runtime_context/ACTIVE_PLAN.yaml` for current tasks
2. **Documentation:** All content organized in `docs/` by type
3. **Structured Data:** YAML files in `data/` for easy reference
4. **Templates:** Reusable assets in `callables/templates/`
5. **Evidence:** Source material and analysis in `evidence/`

## Compliance Notes

⚠️ **Critical:** All generated content must:
- Pass "no sales" compliance validation
- Use permission-based language only
- Maintain brand positioning accurately
- Include required disclaimers (legal advice, etc.)
- Follow emotional engineering framework
